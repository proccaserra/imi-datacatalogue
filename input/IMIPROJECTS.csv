ABIRISK,UL,,GSK,Closed,01/03/2012,28/02/2018,IMI1,3,Group Cross,Anti-Biopharmaceutical Immunization: Prediction and Analysis of Clinical Relevance to Minimize the Risk,Biologicals:Tools for predicting/monitoring efficacy:Manufacturing technologies,RIA (Research and Innovation Action),115303,18 170 217,9 573 494,,5 107 345,"A growing number of medicines are based on biological molecules such as proteins and monoclonal antibodies. These novel drugs have resulted in new, more effective treatments for a number of serious conditions. Yet sometimes these medicines trigger a response from the patient’s immune system, which can decrease the effectiveness of the drug or cause severe side effects. The aim of the IMI-funded ABIRISK project is to shed new light on the factors behind this immune response. The project, which represents the first concerted effort to solve this problem, will aid in the creation of new, safer biopharmaceuticals and also generate tools to determine how individual patients are likely to respond to them both in clinical trials and after release to the market.
Biopharmaceuticals are drugs that are biological in origin (i.e. are made of proteins or DNA for example) and are manufactured using biotechnology. A number of biopharmaceuticals are already in use and have dramatically improved quality of life for patients with serious, hard to treat conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Crohn’s disease, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, haemophilia A and some cancers. However, in some patients, biopharmaceuticals can trigger an immune reaction, a phenomenon known as immunogenicity. When this happens, the immune system produces antibodies (ADAs) that neutralise the drug, which can reduce the effectiveness of the biopharmaceutical. In some patients, the immune response causes side effects such as a rash, chest pains, or a fall in blood pressure. In the most severe cases, it can trigger anaphylactic shock and even prove fatal.Immunogenicity – the known unknowns
Diverse factors appear to be involved in immunogenicity. On the drug side, both the compound and the route and duration of administration seem to play a role, while on the patient side, the type of disease, age, genetic background and interactions with other medicines may be risk factors.  Therefore it is extremely hard to predict which biopharmaceuticals will have immunogenicity problems; although many tests exist, these are not always accurate. Furthermore, knowing which patients are at greatest risk of mounting an immune response to a given biopharmaceutical is extremely difficult.Reducing the risks
Even though immunogenicity continues to pose a problem in the development of new drugs, until now there has been no major effort to solve the problem. Enter the ABIRISK project, which aims to give biopharmaceuticals a much-needed boost and represents the first concerted effort to tackle the immunogenicity problem by bringing together leading experts from hospitals, academia, industry and small companies. The project will set up laboratory tests to probe the immunogenicity of several biopharmaceuticals that are already used on patients. The scientists will then match their test findings with the effect the drug actually has on patients. This will help the team to develop tools that are better at predicting immunogenicity during drug development.Many pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions and patient registries have large amounts of data on biopharmaceuticals and patients’ responses to them. In ABIRISK, these diverse databases will be assembled into a single immunogenicity databank that will help researchers pinpoint the factors that influence a drug’s immunogenicity and patients’ risk of it. This will allow the researchers to generate tools that will accurately predict whether a patient will mount an immune response to a biopharmaceutical and how that immune response will affect the efficacy and safety of the drug.Safer, more effective drugs for patients
Immunogenicity means many patients today are denied the life-changing benefits of biopharmaceuticals. ABIRISK will ultimately result in a new generation of biopharmaceuticals with lower immunogenicity that can be safely and effectively used by more patients. In addition, the project will allow clinicians to determine which patients will respond best to which biopharmaceutical, thereby preventing patients from suffering the side effects of a drug that does not suit them.For Europe’s pharmaceutical industry, better tests will help companies identify the safest, most effective biopharmaceuticals and weed out those that pose a high immunogenicity risk earlier in the drug development process. This will save companies both time and money. Finally, by adding to our knowledge of the mechanisms behind immunogenicity, the project will help to improve regulatory guidelines for the approval of biopharmaceuticals.","Bayer Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany:Glaxosmithkline Research And Development LTD., Brentford, Middlesex, United Kingdom:Ipsen Innovation SAS, Les Ulis, France:Merck Kommanditgesellschaft Auf Aktien, Darmstadt, Germany:Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland:Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark:Pfizer Limited, Sandwich, Kent , United Kingdom:Sanofi-Aventis Recherche & Developpement, Chilly Mazarin, France:UCB Biopharma SPRL, Brussels, Belgium","Academisch Medisch Centrum bij de Universiteit van Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands:Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden, Leiden, Netherlands:Assistance Publique - Hopitaux De Paris, Paris, France:Bundesinstitut Fur Impfstoffe Und Biomedizinische Arzneimittel, Langen, Germany:Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, Paris, France:Commissariat A L Energie Atomique Et Aux Energies Alternatives, Paris, France:Fondazione Per L'Istituto Di Ricerc A In Biomedicina, Bellinzona, Switzerland:Fundacio Hospital Universitari Vall D'Hebron - Institut De Recerca, Barcelona, Spain:Groupe D'Etudes Therapeutiques Desaffections Inflammatoires Digestives Association, Paris, France:Heinrich-Heine-Universitaet Duesseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany:Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, Paris, France:Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy:Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universitatfrankfurt Am Main, Frankfurt am Main, Germany:Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden:Klinikum Rechts Der Isar Der Technischen Universitat Munchen, Muenchen, Germany:Medizinische Universitat Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria:Queen Mary University Of London, London, United Kingdom:Region Hovedstaden, Hilleroed, Denmark:Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel:The Health Corporation – RAMBAM, Haifa, Israel:Universita Degli Studi Di Firenze, Florence, Italy:Universitaetsklinikum Bonn, Bonn, Germany:University College London, London, United Kingdom:University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland:Univerzita Karlova, Prague 1, Czech Republic","ALTA Ricerca e Sviluppo in Biotecnologie S.r.l.u., Siena, Italy:Biomonitor A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark:SciCross AB, Skovde, Sweden","DRK-Blutspendedienst Baden-Württemberg – Hessen gemeinnützige GmbH, Mannheim, Germany","Université François Rabelais de Tours, Tours - BP12050, France:Université Paris-Sud, Orsay, France",Academisch Medisch Centrum bij de Universiteit van Amsterdam:799 973:Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden:555 396:ALTA Ricerca e Sviluppo in Biotecnologie S.r.l.u.:438 672:Assistance Publique - Hopitaux De Paris:435 626:Biomonitor A/S:627 000:Bundesinstitut Fur Impfstoffe Und Biomedizinische Arzneimittel:633 868:Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs:312 589:Commissariat A L Energie Atomique Et Aux Energies Alternatives:739 970:DRK-Blutspendedienst Baden-Württemberg – Hessen gemeinnützige GmbH:268 372:Fondazione Per L'Istituto Di Ricerc A In Biomedicina:729 599:Fundacio Hospital Universitari Vall D'Hebron - Institut De Recerca:353 678:Groupe D'Etudes Therapeutiques Desaffections Inflammatoires Digestives Association:494 079:Heinrich-Heine-Universitaet Duesseldorf:536 525:Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale:3 296 526:Istituto Giannina Gaslini:422 175:Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universitatfrankfurt Am Main:526 630:Karolinska Institutet:570 619:Klinikum Rechts Der Isar Der Technischen Universitat Munchen:658 000:Medizinische Universitat Innsbruck:714 470:Queen Mary University Of London:261 905:Region Hovedstaden:306 812:SciCross AB:345 958:Sheba Medical Center:12 680:The Health Corporation – RAMBAM:151 883:Universita Degli Studi Di Firenze:610 139:Universitaetsklinikum Bonn:536 309:University College London:1 683 976:University Hospital Basel:229 481:Univerzita Karlova:307 839:Université François Rabelais de Tours:98 568:Université Paris-Sud:510 900:Total Cost:18 170 217,http://www.abirisk.eu,Yes,"IMI: Ann Martin

The ADAPTED project aims to boost the development of new medicines by investigating an area of AD research which has previously received little attention – the APOE gene. The APOE gene is a well-known risk factor for developing the disease, but precisely how this gene contributes to the risk of developing AD is not known. People who carry the APOE4 version of the gene have a considerably higher risk of developing AD. They also tend to develop the disease much earlier in life. However, the reasons for this are not well understood and therefore APOE has largely been ignored in the quest to find treatments for AD. By bringing together leading experts in a range of state-of-the-art technologies, including three research-intensive small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), ADAPTED hopes to gain better insights into the causes of AD, something that will in turn lead to better treatments for patients.",,,,,,,NA,#N/A,#N/A,"Miren GURRUTXAGA,

ADAPT-SMART,,,TI Pharma,Closed,01/07/2015,30/04/2018,IMI2,4,Group Standard,"Accelerated development of appropriate patient therapies: a sustainable, multi-stakeholder approach from research to treatment-outcomes","Clinical trial design:Real-world data, evidence:Regulatory and HTA processes",CSA (Coordination and Support Action),115890,1 130 000,2 187 631,,746 515,"Today’s paradigms of bringing innovation to patients are challenged by new developments, such as a growing patient demand for timely access to promising therapies, and increased fragmentation of patient populations due to better disease stratification. To address these challenges, major adaptations to current paradigms are needed while still staying in the EU legal framework. The ADAPT-SMART project set out to address that gap. The project created a multi-stakeholder platform where the conditions and feasibility of medicines adaptive pathway to patients (MAPPs) implementation within the EU/legal context could be discussed. One of the main project achievements was a change in mindset in the healthcare ecosystem, which could contribute to fostering access to treatments for the right patient groups at the earliest appropriate time in the product lifespan.Europe faces many challenges in bringing new medicines to patients in an efficient and timely manner. The reasons for this include the high attrition rates in medicine development, a regulatory environment lagging behind rapidly evolving science, and research and development (R&D) and price/reimbursement models that are no longer financially viable.Medicines adaptive pathways to patients (MAPPs) refers to a concept that seeks to provide patients with timely access to beneficial medicines, starting from a small group of well-identified patients (e.g. those with no alternative treatments). As evidence accumulates on the benefits and risks of a medicine, access may be extended to other groups of patients. MAPPs relate to a flexible pathway covering the entire life cycle of a medicine, from development, through licensing, to patient access (pricing/reimbursement and healthcare delivery).By bringing together representatives from key European stakeholder groups – regulatory agencies, health technology assessment (HTA) bodies, pharmaceutical companies, payers, patients and health care professionals – ADAPT-SMART created a platform where the conditions and feasibility of MAPPs implementation within the EU regulatory/legal context could be discussed openly. As a result, the project contributed to an improved understanding among stakeholders of the issues promoting early access of medicinal products to patients.Embracing the lifespan approachThanks to ADAPT-SMART, there is now a wide acceptance among different stakeholders that medicines development should take the lifespan approach. Whereas in the past the prevailing idea was that a drug should be developed for 5 to 10 years, then launched and left out there for patients to use, this project reinforced the idea of continuous evaluation and use. The project came up with recommendations on how the system could be improved at the various decision points in the product lifespan, including before and after licencing. This means that patients who are running out of time could get access to new drugs more quickly, and that evaluation continues even after the product launch.Other achievementsOther top project outputs include:an overview of conditions which need to be met for entering the MAPPs/adaptive pathway;a definition of the building blocks for early access, appropriate use and the continuous evaluation of medicines;a model for a seamless pathway for early access and continuous evaluations;a recognition that there are no legal constraints in implementing an adaptive pathway approach for medicines development, approval and reimbursement;a glossary of terms to be used in the debate of adaptive pathways and early access;recommendations for potential future IMI research projects which will be important in progressing the implementation of MAPPs.For the benefit of patients, industry and regulatorsIndustry has learned the value of interacting with regulators, HTA bodies and patient organisations throughout the drug development process. Different industry partners have also learned that it is possible to work with each other constructively in the pre-competitive space.Regulators such as the European Medicines Agency also benefitted from their interaction with different stakeholders, especially with HTA bodies and payers. Among other things, having a debate with these downstream decision makers could help them avoid situations where they authorise products which are later rejected for pricing and reimbursement, and never reach patients.ADAPT-SMART also involved two patient organisations as partners in the project. They helped to set the project goals and get results that are meaningful for patients. Furthermore, the recommendations that the project brought forward acknowledge the important role patients should play in the development, approval, reimbursement and appropriate use of medicines.What’s next?The most important results of the project have been published in scientific journals. Additionally, the project published a comprehensive online infographic to help stakeholders to access all the relevant documents. Finally, recommendations and conclusions brought forward by ADAPT-SMART will continue to be debated by different groups of stakeholders, and developed by different groups of researchers, including those involved in future IMI projects.Interview with project coordinators ","AbbVie Ltd, Maidenhead, United Kingdom:Amgen, Brussels, Belgium:Astellas Pharma Europe LTD, Chertsey, United Kingdom:Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Bayer Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany:Boehringer Ingelheim Internationalgmbh, Ingelheim, Germany:Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Basingstoke, United Kingdom:F.

ADVANCE,,,EMC,Closed,01/10/2013,31/03/2019,IMI1,7,Group Standard,Accelerated development of vaccine benefit-risk collaboration in Europe,Infectious diseases:Vaccines:Methods for benefit/risk assessment,RIA (Research and Innovation Action),115557,4 999 811,5 017 223,,1 246 210,"Vaccines are one of the most effective public health measures out, saving some two to three million lives worldwide every year. However, in Europe, public distrust in immunisation programs is limiting high vaccine uptake, resulting in outbreaks of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases that had almost disappeared. Bringing together the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the European Medicines Agency, as well as national public health and regulatory bodies, vaccine manufacturers and academic experts, the ADVANCE project will develop and test methods and guidelines in order to pave the way for a framework capable of rapidly delivering reliable data on the benefits and risks of vaccines that are on the market. This framework should both help regulators and public health authorities make decisions on vaccination strategies, and help maintain public confidence in immunisation as an effective public health tool to control infectious disease.
Immunisation prevents two to three million deaths worldwide every year from diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough) and measles. Millions more are spared the long-term health consequences of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases; the WHO estimates that due to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, five million people are walking today who would otherwise have been paralysed by the virus.In Europe, one of the greatest barriers to the wider uptake of immunisation is distrust, among some sections of the public, of immunisation programmes. This is due largely to fears surrounding vaccine safety. In fact, serious side effects are very rare. Nevertheless, as vaccines are given to healthy people, public acceptance of the risk of any adverse reaction is much lower than for medicines designed to treat sick people; the trade-off between benefit and risk is different.At the same time, some vaccines have been around for so long that many people have no personal experience of the diseases prevented, and so are unaware of just how serious the illness can be.Restoring trustVaccines undergo rigorous safety testing before they are approved for public use. Currently, efforts to monitor the coverage, benefits and risks of vaccines after approval are rather fragmented.The goal of ADVANCE is to review, develop and test methods, data sources and procedures which should feed into a blueprint of an efficient and sustainable pan-European framework that can rapidly deliver robust quantitative data for the assessment of the benefits and risks of vaccines that are on the market. Such a framework would allow regulators and public health authorities to make fast, informed decisions regarding vaccination strategies, and help to maintain public confidence in vaccines, particularly when questions are raised in the media about the safety of specific vaccines.For example, such a framework could have more rapidly assessed and quantified the benefits and risks of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, uptake of which fell in the UK in the years following the claim that it causes autism. Although that claim is now discredited and the doctor behind the claims has been struck off the medical register, uptake of the vaccine remains below the recommended threshold of 95%. A recent measles outbreak centred around the city of Swansea in south Wales (where vaccination levels were particularly low) saw over 1 200 people fall ill, of which 80 were hospitalised and 1 died.The good news is that pilot studies have demonstrated the feasibility of setting up the components of such a framework in Europe, although turning it into a sustainable reality will not be easy. Data on vaccine-preventable diseases, vaccination coverage and adverse reactions to vaccines exist in many places and diverse formats, such as electronic health records, disease surveillance systems, and other healthcare databases. The ADVANCE team will have to identify and profile data sources capable of yielding rapid access to information on the burden of disease, vaccine coverage, and the benefits and risks of vaccines. Another challenge for the team will be developing the tools to link up this data and analysing it, taking into account the interoperability of the data sources and associated ethical and legal issues.The project will run a number-of-proof of concept studies to ensure the platform meets the needs of its users. In order to cover the most common situations, these studies should ideally cover different age groups (e.g. infants / children, adolescents and adults / the elderly), different risk groups (e.g. pregnant women, people with other underlying health problems), and different vaccination scenarios (e.g. vaccinations given annually such as the flu jab, or vaccines introduced into the routine immunisation programme).ADVANCE will also set out the framework’s core values, covering issues such as scientific best practice, a code of conduct, and rules for interactions between the different stakeholders.In all aspects of its work, ADVANCE will build on the results of, and exploit synergies with, related projects. For example, the team will work closely with IMI’s EMIF project on data frameworks, and draw on the PROTECT project’s expertise in analysing and visualising the benefits and risks of medicines.Collaboration is keyIf the ADVANCE blueprint is to be adopted and implemented following the end of the project, it must be accepted by all stakeholders, including the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, national public health bodies, the European Medicines Agency, national regulatory agencies, health ministries, insurance companies, vaccine manufacturers, healthcare providers, and of course the general public. Collaboration between these diverse groups is very sensitive; by bringing them together around the neutral platform offered by IMI, ADVANCE is in a unique position to pave the way for a framework that will improve our ability to rapidly assess the benefits and risks of vaccines and help maintain public confidence in immunisation as a successful and effective public health tool to control infectious disease.","GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium:Janssen Vaccines & Prevention BV, Leiden, Netherlands:Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp, Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, United States :Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland:Pfizer Limited, Sandwich, Kent , United Kingdom:Sanofi Pasteur SA, Lyon, France:Takeda Pharmaceuticals International GmbH, Glattpark-Opfikon (Zurich), Switzerland","Aarhus Universitetshospital, Aarhus Sygehus, Aarhus, Denmark:Agencia Espanola De Medicamentos Y Productos Sanitarios, Madrid, Spain:Agenzia Regionale di Sanita, Firenze, Italy:Asl Della Provincia Di Cremona, Mantova, Italy:Erasmus Universitair Medisch Centrum Rotterdam, Rotterdam, Netherlands:European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Stockholm, Sweden:Fundacio Institut Universitari Pera La Recerca A L'Atencio Primaria De Salut Jordi Gol I Gurina, Barcelona, Spain:Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden:London School Of Hygiene And Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom:Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, London, United Kingdom:Rijksinstituut Voor Volksgezondheid En Milieu, Bilthoven, Netherlands:Royal College of General Practitioners, London, United Kingdom:Sciensano, Brussels, Belgium:Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen S, Denmark:Tampereen Yliopisto, Tampere, Finland:The European Medicines Agency, Canary Wharf, London, United Kingdom:The Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom:Universitat Basel, Basel, Switzerland:University Of Surrey, Guildford, United Kingdom","P95 CVBA, Leuven, Belgium:Societa Servizi Telematici SRL, Padova, Italy:Synapse Research Management Partners SL, Barcelona, Spain","Fundación Española para la Cooperación Internacional, Salud y Política Social, Madrid, Spain:Universitats-Kinderspital Beider Basel, Basel, Switzerland",,"Aarhus Universitetshospital, Aarhus Sygehus:155 764:Agencia Espanola De Medicamentos Y Productos Sanitarios:125 452:Agenzia Regionale di Sanita:33 290:Asl Della Provincia Di Cremona:164 699:Erasmus Universitair Medisch Centrum Rotterdam:546 123:European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control:313 394:Fundacio Institut Universitari Pera La Recerca A L'Atencio Primaria De Salut Jordi Gol I Gurina:33 290:Karolinska Institutet:87 430:London School Of Hygiene And Tropical Medicine:89 533:Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency:36 654:P95 CVBA:486 613:Rijksinstituut Voor Volksgezondheid En Milieu:224 664:Royal College of General Practitioners:166 275:Sciensano:199 290:Societa Servizi Telematici SRL:109 683:Statens Serum Institut:220 419:Synapse Research Management Partners SL:700 949:Tampereen Yliopisto:161 195:The European Medicines Agency:219 246:The Open University:82 174:Universitat Basel:77 094:University Of Surrey:462 600:Universitats-Kinderspital Beider Basel:303 980:Total Cost:4 999 811",NA,Yes,"IMI: Angela Wittelsberger

This means that a treatment that works in one patient may prove ineffective in another. There is now broad recognition that a new approach to disease classification is needed, and that is where the AETIONOMY project comes in. It will pave the way towards a new approach to the classification of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, thereby improving drug development and increasing patients’ chances of receiving a treatment that works for them.
Dementia affects 44 million people globally, and that figure is set to rise to 135 million by 2050, mostly due to the ageing of the population. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia, accounting for between 60% and 80% of all cases. Meanwhile an estimated 4-6 million people globally suffer from Parkinson’s disease. There is no cure for these devastating diseases, and caring for patients as their disease progresses represents an immense burden for family members, carers, and health and social care systems.Developing new treatments for brain disorders takes longer and costs more than for other disease areas. When it comes to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, the way these diseases are classified is hampering efforts to develop effective, targeted treatments.Currently, diseases are defined largely on the basis of the patient’s symptoms and where they occur in the body. Many are classified based simply on the name of the doctor or researcher who first discovered or described the disease – this is the case for both (Alois) Alzheimer’s and (James) Parkinson’s diseases.Rethinking classification: from effect to causeThere is growing evidence that while two patients may be classified as having the same disease, the genetic or molecular causes of their symptoms may be very different. This means that a treatment that works in one patient will prove ineffective in another. In other cases, diseases that are currently defined as separate conditions may share a common molecular basis. There is therefore now broad recognition that the way diseases are classified needs to change, and the field of neurodegenerative diseases in particular is considered to be ripe for a rethink.This is an ambitious project: there are few meaningful correlations or causal links between disease features at the molecular level (e.g. genetic mutations or gene activity), features at the tissue / organ level (e.g. changes in the brain), and features at the clinical level (including symptoms and the results of imaging scans). Even in cases where the disease runs in families, it is not uncommon to find family members who share the same genetic mutation but have different clinical symptoms. For most patients, the disease is simply described as ‘idiopathic’, meaning the cause is unknown.Nevertheless, the literature, public databases, and private companies have vast amounts of data that could be used to pave the way for a better classification of patients, based on underlying causes instead of symptoms. However, we lack an efficient way to generate new knowledge from these resources, and that is where the AETIONOMY project comes in.The AETIONOMY team will tackle the problem of how to dynamically organise and structure different types of data (ranging from molecular data to information on symptoms) and how to apply this knowledge to construct a new classification of patient groups based on the underlying causes of their disease. Achieving this is far beyond the scope of any single company or university; the key to AETIONOMY’s success will be the broad nature of the project consortium, which brings together pharmaceutical companies, universities, and two patient groups, and boasts expertise in neurodegenerative diseases, molecular biology, clinical research, research ethics, data modelling and simulation, data standards, and patient involvement in research.The new project will deliver data, tools and recommendations that can be used by the biomedical community and regulators to develop and approve new treatments and diagnostic tests.For example, the new classification will help drug companies identify the most promising targets for new drugs and, crucially, the patients mostly likely to benefit from any resulting medicines.An urgent need for new treatmentsThere are currently no drugs capable of curing Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s diseases, and the few treatments designed to alleviate symptoms are not effective in all patients. By identifying sub-groups of patients based on the underlying, molecular cause of their disease, AETIONOMY will usher in a new era of personalised medicine, in which patients’ treatments will be determined on the basis of the cause of their disease, not its effects.","Boehringer Ingelheim Internationalgmbh, Ingelheim, Germany:Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland:Sanofi-Aventis Recherche & Developpement, Chilly Mazarin, France:UCB Biopharma SPRL, Brussels, Belgium","Consorci Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain:Erasmus Universitair Medisch Centrum Rotterdam, Rotterdam, Netherlands:Fraunhofer Gesellschaft Zur Foerderung Der Angewandten Forschung E.V., München, Germany:Fundacio Barcelonabeta Brain Research Center, Barcelona, Spain:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Universitaet Hannover, Hannover, Germany:Institut du Cerveau et de la Moelle épinière, Paris, France:Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden:Universitaetsklinikum Bonn, Bonn, Germany:Universite D'Aix Marseille, Marseille, France:Universite Du Luxembourg, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg","Alzheimer Europe, Luxembourg, Luxembourg:Pharmacoidea Fejleszto Es Szolgaltato Kft, Szeged, Hungary","Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, Paris, France",,Alzheimer Europe:99 000:Consorci Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer:340 710:Erasmus Universitair Medisch Centrum Rotterdam:314 835:Fraunhofer Gesellschaft Zur Foerderung Der Angewandten Forschung E.V.:1 743 513:Fundacio Barcelonabeta Brain Research Center:209 778:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Universitaet Hannover:276 855:Institut du Cerveau et de la Moelle épinière:1 280 914:Karolinska Institutet:876 010:Pharmacoidea Fejleszto Es Szolgaltato Kft:359 103:Sc Neurorad SRL (left the project):70 238:Universitaetsklinikum Bonn:1 172 160:Universite D'Aix Marseille:264 357:Universite Du Luxembourg:325 355:University College London (left the project):184 011:Institut des Neurosciences Translationnelles de Paris (left the project):242 395:Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale:234 000:Total Cost:7 993 234,https://www.aetionomy.eu,Yes,"IMI: Elisabetta Vaudano

APPROACH,UL,,GSK,Ongoing,01/06/2015,30/11/2020,IMI1,11,Group Chronic diseases,Applied public-private research enabling osteoarthritis clinical headway,Osteoarthritis:Target identification,RIA (Research and Innovation Action),115770,7 500 000,7 443 323,,2 306 684,"Some 9.6% of men and 18% of women over 60 suffer from osteoarthritis, and a quarter of those affected struggle to carry out ordinary daily activities. However, developing effective treatments for this debilitating condition is extremely challenging. The APPROACH project is creating a platform comprising data on over 10 000 patients and healthy people. The project team will use this data to identify groups of patients with similar profiles; these groups could respond well to specific treatments. This information will ultimately be used to identify patients who could take part in clinical trials of more personalised treatments for osteoarthritis.
The burden of the disease is increasing yet there is no cureIt is estimated that 9.6% of men and 18% of women over the age of 60 worldwide experience the debilitating symptoms of osteoarthritis. As people tend to live longer, and the population of people over 60 is increasing, cases of the disease are on the rise. Direct and indirect costs of osteoarthritis in the EU are already substantial: in the UK alone, total costs for adaptive aids and devices, medicines, surgery and time off work are estimated to be equivalent to 1% of the gross national product per year. The burden will be greatest in developing countries, where life expectancy is increasing and access to arthroplasty and joint replacement is not readily available. Furthermore, although there are a wide range of devices and palliative medicines available that can relieve pain and improve quality of life, there are currently no pharmaceutical products that can halt or reverse the onset of osteoarthritis.Despite the large and growing burden of this disease, many pharmaceutical companies have reduced or altogether abandoned drug development. One of the problems is that there are currently no reliable ways of measuring whether a specific treatment is working or not. This is partly because the mechanisms which lead to the disease in different subgroups of patients are poorly understood. Moreover, although the current mind-set for treatment in this field is moving towards personalised medicine, there are no accepted methods of classifying the patients according to diagnosis methodology, prognosis and treatment plan. It is clear that a better understanding of the disease is urgently needed.Complex algorithms to hunt for disease subtypesBy bringing together a strong team of 25 partners from European clinical centres, basic research institutes, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and pharmaceutical companies, the APPROACH consortium will combine biomedical data of more than 10 000 patients and heathy people from 8 existing cohorts into a unified bioinformatics platform. With the help of complex algorithms, bioinformaticians will comb through this central database to identify subtypes or phenotypes of osteoarthritis. These subtypes will then be validated in a longitudinal clinical study, using existing and newly-developed biological markers. Ultimately, the identification of subtypes of this disease should lead to improved drug development and diagnostic tools, allowing osteoarthritis patients to receive better, more personalised treatment.The project will focus on knee osteoarthritis – a very common form of osteoarthritis which is a major cause of impaired mobility (particularly in women) and therefore has a high clinical burden. This form of the disease is ideal for the APPROACH database because it has been extensively examined in large groups of patients and lots of standardised data, such as x-ray and MRI measurements, is available.Valuable tools and outcomesAt the end of the project, APPROACH will provide valuable tools, methods and definitions that will be used to optimise future clinical trials for osteoarthritis, paving the way for personalised medicine. More specifically, the main outcomes of the project will be as follows:an integrated bioinformatics platform which functions as a repository for clinical data, biomarker data, images, as well as storage of bio-tissues from a broad spectrum of osteoarthritis patients;subsets of patients based on well-defined subtypes or phenotypes of the disease;new biological markers for osteoarthritis based on imaging, locomotion and biochemical methods;validation and optimisation of the next generation imaging methodologies, human motion analysis and biochemical methods to enable more efficient diagnosis and treatment of osteoarthritis patients.A big step towards more personalised medicine for patientsBy identifying different subtypes of osteoarthritis, APPROACH will make a big step forward in helping the pharmaceutical companies develop more effective treatments for the osteoarthritis patients. Patients will reap the greatest benefits as the identification of disease subtypes will lead to improved diagnostic tools and more effective, highly personalised treatments.","Glaxosmithkline Research And Development LTD., Brentford, Middlesex, United Kingdom:Institut De Recherches Internationales Servier, Suresnes, France:Merck Kommanditgesellschaft Auf Aktien, Darmstadt, Germany","Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden, Leiden, Netherlands:Arthritis Research UK, Chesterfield, United Kingdom:Assistance Publique - Hopitaux De Paris, Paris, France:Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, Paris, France:Diakonhjemmet Hospital, Oslo, Norway:Friedrich-Alexander University (FAU) Erlangen-Nürnberg, Erlangen, Germany:Lunds Universitet, Lund, Sweden:Servizo Galego De Saude, Santiago de Compostela, Spain:Universitair Medisch Centrum Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands:Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany:University Of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom:University Of Newcastle Upon Tyne, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom:University Of Surrey, Guildford, United Kingdom","Artialis SA, Liège (Sart-Tilman), Belgium:European Technology for Business Ltd, Luton, United Kingdom:Hemics B.V., Eindhoven, Netherlands:Nordic Bioscience Compound Development A/S, Herlev, Denmark:Stichting Lygature, Utrecht, Netherlands","Stichting Nationaal Reumafonds, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Universite Paris Diderot - Paris 7, Paris, France",Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden:701 010:Artialis SA:250 000:Assistance Publique - Hopitaux De Paris:178 050:Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs:66 000:Diakonhjemmet Hospital:163 040:European Technology for Business Ltd:185 000:Friedrich-Alexander University (FAU) Erlangen-Nürnberg:75 000:Hemics B.V.:200 000:Lunds Universitet:162 500:Medizinische Universitaet Wien (left the project):49 000:Servizo Galego De Saude:458 000:Stichting Lygature:695 000:Stichting Nationaal Reumafonds:112 500:Universitair Medisch Centrum Utrecht:2 990 900:Universitatsklinikum Erlangen:35 000:University Of Leeds:150 000:University Of Newcastle Upon Tyne:550 000:University Of Surrey:470 000:Universite Paris Diderot - Paris 7:9 000:Total Cost:7 500 000,https://www.approachproject.eu,missing from list,"IMI: Maria Teresa De Magistris

What’s more, a third of deaths from CVD occur in the under 75s. On the economic front, CVD costs the EU around EUR 210 billion a year, with healthcare costs accounting for just over half of this figure. Three diseases – atrial fibrillation (AF), heart failure (HF) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are major drivers of CVD.

New and better vaccines are still urgently needed, yet their introduction is hampered by lengthy and expensive vaccine safety testing procedures. The aim of the IMI-funded BIOVACSAFE project is to develop cutting edge tools to speed up and improve the testing and monitoring of vaccine safety, both before and after release to the market. By bringing together Europe’s top industrial and academic teams for the first time, the project will ultimately usher in a new generation of safer, more effective vaccines.
Vaccines are widely acknowledged to be one of the cheapest and most efficient ways to combat infectious diseases in both developed and developing countries. With billions of doses of vaccines administered globally every year, vaccine safety is a top priority for pharmaceutical companies, regulators and the public alike. The problem is that testing and monitoring new vaccines for safety is a slow, cumbersome, and extremely expensive process; the development of a new vaccine costs millions of euros, and less than 1 vaccine in 10 makes it through clinical testing.
As companies add new components to vaccines to make them more effective, testing them for safety becomes even more challenging. And, while severe adverse reactions to vaccines are rare, predicting who is at risk of a severe reaction is extremely difficult; this problem will be further complicated by the ageing of the population and the growing burden of chronic conditions and diseases of the immune system.A new approach to vaccine safetyThe BIOVACSAFE project will draw on the latest life science research findings to profile, in great detail, how individuals respond to the different components of vaccines at the cellular, genetic and molecular level. This will allow the project team to develop tools that can rapidly and accurately identify warning signs that a potential vaccine may be reactogenic. The tools could be employed early on in vaccine development, before vast amounts of time and money have been spent. Meanwhile, the team will develop new ways to identify, classify and record adverse reactions to vaccines; this should also boost researchers’ ability to pick up on problems early in vaccine development. Finally, the team will probe how natural illnesses and infections, particularly diseases of the immune system, interact with vaccines. By identifying these interactions, the team hopes to find ways of preventing them occurring in the first place. Finally, the team will create databases that can be used to store information on and explore reactions to vaccines.Towards the next generation of vaccines By coming up with novel ways to identify and better understand the causes of adverse reactions to vaccines at all stages of development, BIOVACSAFE will accelerate the development and introduction of a new generation of safer, more effective vaccines to combat infectious diseases, cancer and chronic diseases. As well as speeding up vaccine development, the new, more accurate tools developed by BIOVACSAFE should help to boost public confidence in vaccine safety. Furthermore, because the project includes studies of populations in both developed and developing countries, its findings should be of global relevance.An injection of health for Europe’s vaccine development sectorBIOVACSAFE brings together for the first time three of Europe’s leading vaccine development and manufacture companies as well as top experts from academic institutions and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). By sharing their expertise as well as access to data and patient groups, all project partners will see their knowledge base and their competitiveness grow. Crucially, by pooling their expertise, the BIOVACSAFE partners have a unique opportunity to make progress in this important area.","GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium:GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines Srl, Siena, Italy:Sanofi Pasteur SA, Lyon, France","CDISC Europe Foundation, Brussels, Belgium:Chalmers Tekniska Hoegskola AB, Goeteborg, Sweden:Commissariat A L Energie Atomique Et Aux Energies Alternatives, Paris, France:Department of Health, Leeds, United Kingdom:Goeteborgs Universitet, Gothenburg, Sweden:Imperial College Of Science Technology And Medicine, London, United Kingdom:Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Munich, Germany:St George’s Hospital Medical School (trading as St George's University of London), London, United Kingdom:Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen S, Denmark:Universita' Degli Studi Di Siena, Siena, Italy:Universiteit Gent, Gent, Belgium:Universiteit Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands:University Of Surrey, Guildford, United Kingdom","ImmunArray Ltd, Rehovot, Israel:Islensk Erfdagreining ehf, Reykjavik, Iceland:Vismederi SRL, Siena, Italy","University Hospital Ghent, Gent, Belgium",,Chalmers Tekniska Hoegskola AB:762 212:Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin (left the project):356 306:Commissariat A L Energie Atomique Et Aux Energies Alternatives:399 999:Department of Health:497 736:Goeteborgs Universitet:777 000:ImmunArray Ltd:925 820:Imperial College Of Science Technology And Medicine:2 336 660:Islensk Erfdagreining ehf (left the project):29 786:Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (left the project):216 203:Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev:2 531 522:Public Health England an Executive Agency of the Dept of Health (left the project):566:St George’s Hospital Medical School (trading as St George's University of London):315 031:Statens Serum Institut:679 216:Universita' Degli Studi Di Siena:1 029 564:Universiteit Gent:2 000 007:Universiteit Utrecht:839 510:University Of Surrey:3 711 632:Total Cost:17 408 770,http://www.biovacsafe.eu,Yes,"IMI: Ann Martin

The ultimate goal for therapeutic development is to identify the disease-causing molecular events early in the disease and then influence immunity and inflammation so that functional deterioration is halted, immunity is re-regulated and the disease is cured.
The work from groups within the BTCure consortium (and others) has recently shown that very different genetic, environmental and thus molecular events are needed to trigger different subsets of the disease. Our aim is to develop an understanding of the early process in arthritis subsets that will enable us to develop precise and eventually curative treatments to be used before irreversible destruction and loss of joint function and mobility have occurred in patients.The BTCure project will develop new diagnostic methods to discover the early forms of RA and RA-like diseases and new tools to differentiate the different forms of RA and RA-like diseases, where different molecular mechanisms are involved and where different therapies may be required.To achieve these goals, samples from biobanks will be analysed in vitro and models will be aligned with different variants of human arthritis. In addition, new models will be established using similar molecular pathways as the relevant human arthritis subsets, leading to the understanding of the etiology and early pathology of the disease for a program aimed at early and curative treatment of RA and RA-like diseases. A major focus of these efforts will be to understand and subsequently alter the adaptive immune reactions in patients from a disease-inducing mode into either a protective mode against the disease or become asymptomatic. Advances made through initial research into the pathology of this group of diseases have been successful, given enough information available on the nature and regulation of disease-inducing and disease-protective immunity. With these tools at hand, we will be able to use new understanding of aetiology and early pathology of human disease for a program aimed at early and ultimately curative treatment of human RA and RA-like diseases.  ","Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Boehringer Ingelheim Internationalgmbh, Ingelheim, Germany:Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Corp, Princeton, NJ, United States :Glaxosmithkline Research And Development LTD., Brentford, Middlesex, United Kingdom:Janssen Biologics BV, Leiden, Netherlands:Merck Kommanditgesellschaft Auf Aktien, Darmstadt, Germany:Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark:Pfizer Limited, Sandwich, Kent , United Kingdom:UCB Biopharma SPRL, Brussels, Belgium","Academisch Medisch Centrum bij de Universiteit van Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands:Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden, Leiden, Netherlands:Agencia Estatal Consejo Superior De Investigaciones Cientificas, Madrid, Spain:Biomedical Sciences Research Center ""Alexander Fleming"", Vari - Athens, Greece:Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Montpellier, Montpellier, France:Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany:Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum Berlin, Berlin, Germany:Diakonhjemmet Hospital, Oslo, Norway:Fondazione Humanitas Per La Ricerca, Rozzano, Italy:Idryma Iatroviologikon Ereunon Akademias Athinon, Athens, Greece:Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, Paris, France:Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden:King'S College London, London, United Kingdom:Medizinische Universitaet Wien, Vienna, Austria:Revmatologicky ustav, Praha, Czech Republic:Stichting Katholieke Universiteit, Nijmegen, Netherlands:The University Of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom:Universitat Zurich, Zürich, Switzerland:Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany:University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland:University Of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom:University Of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom:University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom:Uppsala Universitet, Uppsala, Sweden","Arthrogen BV, Amsterdam, Netherlands:Biomedcode Hellas SA, Vari, Greece:Firalis SAS, Huningue, France:Redoxis AB, Lund, Sweden","Phadia AB, Upssala, Sweden",,"Academisch Medisch Centrum bij de Universiteit van Amsterdam:1 122 895:Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden:1 810 684:Agencia Estatal Consejo Superior De Investigaciones Cientificas:277 960:Biomedcode Hellas SA:99 099:Biomedical Sciences Research Center ""Alexander Fleming"":852 394:Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Montpellier:367 518:Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin:601 846:Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum Berlin:377 625:Diakonhjemmet Hospital:92 226:Firalis SAS:89 577:Fondazione Humanitas Per La Ricerca:609 993:Idryma Iatroviologikon Ereunon Akademias Athinon:330 746:Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale:281 363:Karolinska Institutet:3 279 727:King'S College London:544 792:Medizinische Universitaet Wien:852 328:Redoxis AB:1 035:Revmatologicky ustav:279 240:Stichting Katholieke Universiteit:415 024:TcLand Expression (left the project):80 113:The University Of Manchester:592 841:Universitat Zurich:1 008 920:Universitatsklinikum Erlangen:864 761:University College Dublin:366 269:University Of Glasgow:743 191:University Of Leeds:600 769:University of Oxford:549 246:Uppsala Universitet:270 690:Total Cost:17 362 872",http://btcure.eu,Yes,"IMI: Ann Martin

Obtaining these cells usually requires a biopsy, an often invasive procedure. The CANCER-ID project aims to develop new, less invasive ways of capturing cancer cells and genetic material from tumours from blood samples and analysing them for clues to what treatment is needed and how well drugs are working. The project will focus initially on specific types of lung and breast cancer.
Monitoring treatment response still challenging
With more than 3 million new cases and 1.7 million deaths each year, cancer represents the second most important cause of death and illness in Europe, after cardio-vascular disease. New, more targeted treatments are emerging and a significant proportion of cancers can be cured or at least their progression can be slowed, especially if they are detected early. However, one of the main problems for doctors and patients remains monitoring the response to treatment in real time and detecting potential tumour mutations which can lead to drug resistance.Cancer clues hiding in the blood
Currently tissue biopsies are used to diagnose and monitor the disease, but doctors cannot perform these too often because they are invasive, costly, and often risky for the patient. However, cancer is a highly dynamic disease and real-time diagnostic evaluation is very much needed to determine the best personalised treatment for patients at a given time.Now a new solution is on the horizon. Tumours shed cells and fragments of DNA into the bloodstream and these ‘biomarkers’ can potentially be used to non-invasively screen for early-stage cancers, monitor responses to treatment and help explain why some cancers are resistant to therapies. Technical advances over the last two decades have enabled the extraction of these biomarkers from the blood, in a process which is called ‘liquid biopsy’. Although promising, this new method is not without challenges: looking for these biomarkers in the blood is often like looking for a needle in the haystack made up of billions of normal blood cells. Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation, validation and head-to-head comparison of these new technologies have not yet been done. IMI’s CANCER-ID project aims to fill this gap.Collaborative effort needed
By bringing together companies and institutions in the fields of tumour biology and cancer therapy, biomarker development, clinical sciences and bioinformatics, as well as regulatory agencies and patient advocacy groups, CANCER-ID will compare, evaluate and validate the most promising non-invasive technologies for liquid biopsy. With its over 30 partners from across Europe / the world, this project will bridge the gap between research focused on these novel methods and validating the most mature technologies so they can be adopted and brought to the patients as soon as possible.The project will be divided into three key phases:In the pre-evaluation phase, liquid biopsy technologies will be evaluated and the criteria will be set for any of the technologies to move to the next phase.In the technical evaluation phase, the technologies identified as promising will be tested on patient samples.In the third stage, validated methods will be used on patients as part of clinical studies.  Lung and breast cancer as pilots
Validating these new technologies on all cancer types would be unmanageable. That’s why the project will focus on two-types of cancer: lung and breast cancer. Between them, lung and breast cancer account for approximately 760 000 new cases of cancer per year in the EU and are responsible for more than 50% of cancer-related deaths in women. Blood-based diagnostics will be important to improve treatment and to design new clinical trials in these patients.More specifically, these two types of cancer have been selected for the following reasons:Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. In the EU, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among men in all countries except Sweden and women die from lung cancer more commonly than from breast cancer in a growing number of countries. Treatments with targeted drugs perform better than traditional chemotherapy. However, one obstacle is the difficulty in obtaining serial biopsies to chart tumour evolution and the emergence of drug resistance. For these reasons, CANCER-ID has selected lung cancer for development, optimisation and standardisation of the liquid biopsy biomarkers.Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. Although several therapeutic options are readily available, resistance to these therapies often significantly limits the success rate. HER2 is the most prominent molecular target in breast cancer and it defines a clear molecular subtype. In CANCER-ID, researchers will focus on breast cancer patients who failed to respond to HER2-targeted therapies. Resistance to HER2-targeted therapies represents a serious medical problem and there is an urgent need to develop novel diagnostic tests for the early detection of resistance.Both patients and industry to benefit
Once validated and approved for use in patients, these new methods will have a significant value for patients, physicians and payers since they will prevent exposure of patients to drugs that are unlikely to be beneficial. Moreover, validated biomarker tests will be extremely important for the pharmaceutical industry as they will help reduce the very high dropout rate in clinical development by selecting the right patients for the right drugs.","Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, Leverkusen, Germany:Boehringer Ingelheim Internationalgmbh, Ingelheim, Germany:Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Basingstoke, United Kingdom:Institut De Recherches Servier, Suresnes, France:Orion Oyj, Espoo, Finland:Silicon Biosystems S.p.A., Bologna, Italy","ANGLE Europe Ltd, Guildford, United Kingdom:Academisch Ziekenhuis Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands:Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany:Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany:Ethniko Kai Kapodistriako Panepistimio Athinon, Athens, Greece:European Organisation For Research And Treatment Of Cancer Aisbl, Brussels, Belgium:Heinrich-Heine-Universitaet Duesseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany:Helsingin Ja Uudenmaan Sairaanhoitopiirin Kuntayhtymä, Helsinki, Finland:Institut Curie, Paris, France:Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France:Luxembourg Institute Of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg:Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften Ev, Munich, Germany:Medizinische Universitat Graz, Graz, Austria:Oslo Universitetssykehus Hf, Oslo, Norway:Participant Legal name 	Istituto Oncologico Veneto IRCCS, Padova, Italy:The University Of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom:Universita Degli Studi Di Torino, Turin, Italy:Universitaetsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany:Universiteit Twente, Enschede, Netherlands:University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom:Université de Montpellier, Montpellier, France","Agena Bioscience GmbH, Hamburg, Germany:Alacris Theranostics GmbH, Berlin, Germany:Arttic, Paris, France:GILUPI GmbH, Potsdam, Germany:Tataa Biocenter AB, Göteborg, Sweden:VyCAP BV, Deventer, Netherlands","Agilent Technologies Sales & Services GmbH & Co.

What’s more, as well as being good for the planet, the methods developed by CHEM21 will also help the pharmaceutical industry to cut costs, resulting in cheaper medicines for patients.
Towards more sustainability in drug manufactureToday, drug manufacture often requires 100 kg of materials to produce just 1 kg of active ingredient. This inefficiency means that many products require long lead times and large facilities for their production and to deal with any waste materials. This is not just bad for the environment; medicines produced in this way are expensive to develop and produce.Meanwhile, another emerging issue for the pharmaceutical sector is the scarcity of precious metals, like platinum, that are essential in the synthesis of many drugs but are being depleted at alarming rates.Solving these problems will require a major revision in the way drugs are synthesised.Smarter synthesisCHEM21 will link leading academics in the field of green chemistry with scientists working in drug synthesis in industry to tackle the challenges found in the commercial manufacture of drugs.Specifically, the CHEM21 project aims to generate a range of technologies for medicines manufacture that are demonstrably more sustainable that existing methods. Part of the project will be devoted to designing catalysts based on common metals (such as copper, iron and nickel) instead of the rarer and more expensive precious metals used now. The team also aims to reduce the amount of solvent used and develop methods that favour starting materials that result in less harmful waste. An additional aim of the team is to provide new tools for medicinal chemists which are greener and are robust for scaling up.Elsewhere, the project plans to boost the use of enzymes as catalysts and to investigate what steps are needed to implement synthetic biology for the sustainable production of more complex molecules.In addition to promoting green and sustainable methodologies among current medicinal and process chemists, CHEM21 wants to make ‘green’ drug production second nature for the next generation of scientists in this area. To this end, the project will develop and disseminate educational material, case studies, and reviews and trial them in selected universities and EFPIA companies.Cheaper medicines for patientsInefficient production processes and the use of rare precious metals raise the costs of drug production. By making drug production more efficient and swapping expensive materials for cheaper alternatives, CHEM 21 will help to lower the cost of medicines.","Bayer Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany:Glaxosmithkline Research And Development LTD., Brentford, Middlesex, United Kingdom:Janssen Pharmaceutica Nv, Beerse, Belgium:Orion Oyj, Espoo, Finland:Pfizer Limited, Sandwich, Kent , United Kingdom:Sanofi Chimie, Gentilly, France","Leibniz - Institut Fur Katalyse Ev An Der Universitat Rostock, Rostock, Germany:Stichting Vu, Amsterdam, Netherlands:The University Of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom:Universitaet Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany:Universiteit Antwerpen, Antwerp, Belgium:University Of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom:University Of York, York, United Kingdom:University of Durham, Durham, United Kingdom","ACIB GmbH, Graz, Austria:CatScI Ltd, Wentloog, Cardiff, United Kingdom:Evolva SA, Reinach, Switzerland:Reaxa Limited, Leeds, United Kingdom:charnwood technical consulting ltd, quorn, United Kingdom","Technische Universitaet Graz, Graz, Austria:Universitaet Graz, Graz, Austria",,ACIB GmbH:780 387:CatScI Ltd:172 871:charnwood technical consulting ltd:232 578:Evolva SA:432 490:Leibniz - Institut Fur Katalyse Ev An Der Universitat Rostock:733 400:Reaxa Limited:150 100:Stichting Vu:504 773:The University Of Manchester:1 577 900:Universitaet Stuttgart:1 210 524:Universiteit Antwerpen:565 403:University of Durham:152 505:University Of Leeds:1 254 942:University Of York:1 501 571:Technische Universitaet Graz:389 507:Universitaet Graz:170 687:Total Cost:9 829 638,https://www.chem21.eu,?,"IMI: Colm Carroll

Worryingly, cases of CRE infections are on the rise in Europe and globally. The COMBACTE-CARE project aims to shed new light on the best ways to understand and treat CRE infections. It will also run clinical trials of a novel antibiotic combination product designed to tackle a sub-type of CRE infections for which there are limited or no treatment options.
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a serious and growing threat to human and animal health worldwide. In the EU alone, AMR is responsible for some 25 000 deaths every year, and the annual treatment and social costs have been estimated at €1.5 billion. Meanwhile, new forms of resistance continue to arise and spread, leaving clinicians with few weapons to bring infections under control. Yet despite the recognised need for new antibiotics, the reality is that only two new classes of antibiotics have been brought to the market in the last three decades.In many cases, where infections are already resistant to many antibiotics, the treatment of last resort is a class of antibiotics called carbapanems. Unfortunately, recent years have seen a rise in cases of infections caused by bacteria known as carbapanem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (CRE) that, as their name suggests, are resistant to carbapanems. CRE infections are most common in healthcare settings. They are extremely hard to treat (very often the only treatment options are combinations of old, toxic antibiotics) and can be fatal.According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), cases of CRE infections have been reported in most European countries and rates of CRE infections are on the rise.Focus on the toughest resistant infectionsCRE infections form the focus of the COMBACTE-CARE project. Simply detecting CRE infections is challenging, as CRE bacteria are extremely diverse. With this in mind, one challenge for the COMBACTE-CARE team will contribute to both the rapid detection and characterisation of CRE infections. They will also work to deliver new knowledge on biological markers that predict which patients with the most serious healthcare-associated infections are at risk of poor outcomes.More broadly, the project will analyse clinical and microbiological data to make recommendations for the development of novel antibiotics to treat resistant infections. They will also carry out research on the clinical management and outcomes of hospitalised patients (including newborn babies, children, and adults) with serious infections to identify the best available treatments.COMBACTE-CARE forms part of IMI’s wider New Drugs for Bad Bugs (ND4BB) programme, and will work closely with and build on the pan-European clinical and laboratory networks (CLIN-Net and LAB-Net) set up by the COMBACTE project. COMBACTE-CARE will focus specifically on building capacity in clinical sites in south-eastern Europe, where rates of multi-drug resistance are particularly high.These networks will allow the team to carry out clinical trials of a novel antibiotic combination product called Aztreonam-Avibactam (ATM-AVI). ATM-AVI is a potential option designed to tackle a sub-type of CRE infections that is especially hard to treat.An urgent needCREs pose a growing threat to patients and health systems in Europe and beyond. By taking steps to improve the way infections are diagnosed and treated, COMBACTE-CARE is well placed to contribute to efforts to tackle these dangerous infections.","Basilea Pharmaceutica International AG, Basel, Switzerland:Glaxosmithkline Research And Development LTD., Brentford, Middlesex, United Kingdom:Pfizer Limited, Sandwich, Kent , United Kingdom","Academisch Medisch Centrum bij de Universiteit van Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands:Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom:Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de LIMOGES, Limoges, France:Ethniko Kai Kapodistriako Panepistimio Athinon, Athens, Greece:Fundacion Privada Instituto De Salud Global Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain:Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, Paris, France:Klinikum Der Universitaet Zu Koeln, Cologne, Germany:MINISTRIA E SHENDETESISE (National Institute of Public Health of Kosovo), Pristina, Kosovo * UN resolution:Servicio Andaluz De Salud, Sevilla, Spain:Servicio Madrileno De Salud, Madrid, Spain:St George’s Hospital Medical School (trading as St George's University of London), London, United Kingdom:Tel Aviv Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel:The Health Corporation – RAMBAM, Haifa, Israel:Universitaet Ulm, Ulm, Germany:Universitaetsklinikum Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany:Universitair Medisch Centrum Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands:Universite De Geneve, Genève 4, Switzerland:Universiteit Antwerpen, Antwerp, Belgium","Centre hospitalier Universitaire de Poitiers, Poitiers, France:Université de Poitiers, Poitiers , France",,,Academisch Medisch Centrum bij de Universiteit van Amsterdam:250 000:Cardiff University:211 039:Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de LIMOGES:1 276 190:Ethniko Kai Kapodistriako Panepistimio Athinon:698 000:Fundacion Privada Instituto De Salud Global Barcelona:218 962:Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale:366 300:Klinikum Der Universitaet Zu Koeln:2 094 471:MINISTRIA E SHENDETESISE (National Institute of Public Health of Kosovo):45 000:Servicio Andaluz De Salud:4 104 556:Servicio Madrileno De Salud:176 900:St George’s Hospital Medical School (trading as St George's University of London):247 500:Tel Aviv Medical Center:888 092:The Health Corporation – RAMBAM:522 200:Universitaet Ulm:121 000:Universitaetsklinikum Freiburg:253 000:Universitair Medisch Centrum Utrecht:10 859 813:Universite De Geneve:162 664:Universiteit Antwerpen:1 209 313:Centre hospitalier Universitaire de Poitiers:40 500:Université de Poitiers:126 000:Total Cost:23 871 500,https://www.combacte.com/COMBACTE-CARE,?,"IMI: Nathalie Seigneuret

Patients in intensive care units (ICUs) are particularly vulnerable to infections, for example in their lungs and airways. Increasingly, these infections are resistant to a range of antibiotics, leaving doctors with few options to treat their patients. The COMBACTE-MAGNET project is evaluating a new approach to preventing and treating life-threatening infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria. It is also setting up a pan-European epidemiological network called ‘EPI-Net’ that will help to optimise the surveillance of antibiotic resistance and healthcare associated infections in Europe.
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a serious and growing threat to human and animal health worldwide. In the EU alone, AMR is responsible for some 25 000 deaths every year, and the annual treatment and social costs have been estimated at €1.5 billion. Meanwhile, new forms of resistance continue to arise and spread, leaving clinicians with few weapons to bring infections under control. Yet despite the recognised need for new antibiotics, the reality is that only two new classes of antibiotics have been brought to the market in the last three decades.Critically-ill patients in hospital intensive care units (ICUs) are particularly prone to infections of the lungs and airways, urinary tract, and intra-abdominal area. Very often, these infections are caused by so-called ‘Gram-negative’ bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. These bacteria are increasingly proving resistant to antibiotics, meaning there is an urgent need for new treatment options. However, the antibiotic development pipeline is running dry.COMBACTE-MAGNET – focus on intensive care patientsThe COMBACTE-MAGNET project takes a new approach to preventing P. aeruginosa infections, especially pulmonary infections in ICU patients, and treating patients with life-threatening infections caused by MDR Gram-negative bacteria, including P. aeruginosa.The project will link up with and add to the pan-European clinical and laboratory networks (CLIN-Net and LAB-Net) set up by COMBACTE, one of the first projects in IMI’s antimicrobial resistance programme New Drugs for Bad Bugs (ND4BB). COMBACTE-MAGNET will also oversee the creation of a new network called EPI-Net, which will map and connect existing surveillance systems in Europe to optimise efforts to monitor the spread of antibiotic resistance and healthcare-associated infections. EPI-Net will draw on the expertise of a range of stakeholders to develop harmonised measures for the surveillance of healthcare associated infections in Europe.Hope for new antibacterialsTwo novel compounds will be developed through clinical trials carried out in COMBACTE-MAGNET.The first, MEDI3902 (developed by MedImmune, AstraZeneca), is a promising new anti-bacterial monoclonal antibody for the treatment of P. aeruginosa infections, especially pulmonary infections, in ICU patients. The project team will carry out Phase 2 and 3 trials in adult ICU patients; these trials, involving larger numbers of patients are designed to gather information on the safety and efficacy of the medicine. The project will also carry out a Phase 1 study of MEDI3902 in children; this study, involving only a small number of children, focuses primarily on safety and understanding how the drug is processed by the body in children.The second drug, AIC499 (developed by AiCuris), a new beta-lactam antibiotic has shown to be effective against a broad range of MDR Gram-negative bacteria. COMBACTE-MAGNET will carry out Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials to assess its safety and efficacy of AIC499. If the trial results are positive, AIC499 could prove useful in the treatment of patients with life-threatening infections.The clinical studies of MEDI3902 and AIC499 will be supported by additional research that will shed new light on the consequences of P. aeruginosa infections. They will also study factors that influence how different patients respond to infection.An urgent needPatients in intensive care are already seriously ill, and infection with a multi-drug resistant bug can prove fatal. COMBACTE-MAGNET brings together leading researchers from academia and industry, and has strong ties with the other projects in IMI’s ND4BB programme as well as other relevant networks. As such it is well placed to advance the development of new, life-saving treatment options for this vulnerable group of patients.","AiCuris Anti-infective Cures GmbH, Wuppertal, Germany:Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Basilea Pharmaceutica International AG, Basel, Switzerland:Glaxosmithkline Research And Development LTD., Brentford, Middlesex, United Kingdom:Sanofi-Aventis Recherche & Developpement, Chilly Mazarin, France","Academisch Medisch Centrum bij de Universiteit van Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands:Assistance Publique - Hopitaux De Paris, Paris, France:Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, Lausanne, Switzerland:Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de LIMOGES, Limoges, France:Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Brussels, Belgium:Consorci Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain:Eberhard Karls Universitaet Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany:Erasmus Universitair Medisch Centrum Rotterdam, Rotterdam, Netherlands:European Forum For Good Clinical Practice, Brussels, Belgium:Fondazione PENTA - for the treatment and care of children with HIV-ONLUS, Padova, Italy:Hospital Universitario Son Espases, Palma, Spain:Inst Cardiometabolisme Nutrition Ican, Paris, France:Institut Català De La Salut, Barcelona, Spain:Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, Paris, France:Medizinische Universitaet Wien, Vienna, Austria:North Bristol National Health Service Trust, Bristol, United Kingdom:Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust, Liverpool, United Kingdom:Servicio Andaluz De Salud, Sevilla, Spain:Servicio Madrileno De Salud, Madrid, Spain:Stichting Katholieke Universiteit, Nijmegen, Netherlands:Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel:The University Of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom:Universita' Degli Studi Di Verona, Verona, Italy:Universitaet Ulm, Ulm, Germany:Universitaetsklinikum Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany:Universitair Medisch Centrum Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands:Universitat Zurich, Zürich, Switzerland:Universite De Geneve, Genève 4, Switzerland:Universiteit Antwerpen, Antwerp, Belgium:University College London, London, United Kingdom:University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom:University of the West of England, Bristol, United Kingdom","TranScrip Partners LLP, Reading, United Kingdom:Ursula Theuretzbacher, Vienna, Austria","Hospital Clinico Y Provincial De Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain:Universite Paris Diderot - Paris 7, Paris, France",,Academisch Medisch Centrum bij de Universiteit van Amsterdam:562 500:Assistance Publique - Hopitaux De Paris:328 320:Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de LIMOGES:33 878 494:Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois:158 800:Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc:663 000:Consorci Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer:281 462:Eberhard Karls Universitaet Tuebingen:1 160 700:Erasmus Universitair Medisch Centrum Rotterdam:262 185:European Forum For Good Clinical Practice:120 000:Fondazione PENTA - for the treatment and care of children with HIV-ONLUS:1 924 200:Hospital Universitario Son Espases:337 500:Inst Cardiometabolisme Nutrition Ican:301 900:Institut Català De La Salut:162 589:Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale:190 469:Medizinische Universitaet Wien:1 974 430:North Bristol National Health Service Trust:14 260 731:Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust:1 698 531:Servicio Andaluz De Salud:1 021 770:Servicio Madrileno De Salud:304 300:Stichting Katholieke Universiteit:776 911:Tel Aviv University:167 053:The University Of Liverpool:372 031:TranScrip Partners LLP:75 000:Universita' Degli Studi Di Verona:2 234 881:Universitaet Ulm:188 550:Universitaetsklinikum Freiburg:471 150:Universitair Medisch Centrum Utrecht:5 439 736:Universitat Zurich:148 050:Universite De Geneve:735 943:Universiteit Antwerpen:3 827 750:University College London:459 206:University of Oxford:180 000:University of the West of England:272 539:Ursula Theuretzbacher:205 000:Hospital Clinico Y Provincial De Barcelona:174 338:Universite Paris Diderot - Paris 7:19 981:Total Cost:75 340 000,https://www.combacte.com/news/combacte-magnet-involving-patients-public-antimicrobial-medicines-development-research/,?,"IMI: Nathalie Seigneuret

Enter the IMI-funded COMBACTE project, which aims to give antibiotic drug development a much-needed boost by pioneering new ways of designing and implementing efficient clinical trials for novel antibiotics. COMBACTE forms part of the New Drugs for Bad Bugs (ND4BB) initiative, IMI’s wider programme to tackle AMR.
The AMR arms race – developing New Drugs for Bad BugsAMR represents a serious and growing threat to human and animal health worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), ‘antibiotic resistance is becoming a public health emergency of yet unknown proportions’. In the EU, AMR is responsible for some 25 000 deaths every year, and the annual treatment and social costs have been estimated at some €1.5 billion. Meanwhile, new forms of resistance continue to arise and spread, leaving clinicians with few weapons to bring infections under control. Yet despite the recognised need for new antibiotics, the reality is that only two new classes of antibiotics have been brought to the market in the last three decades.The reasons for this are manifold. On the scientific front, there is an urgent need for a greater understanding of how antibiotics work, how bacteria develop resistance to them, and what molecular mechanisms could be exploited to get round bacterial defence mechanisms. Running clinical trials on new antibiotics is also problematic due to regulatory requirements and the large numbers of patients required– put simply, a lot of patients have to be recruited to the major studies of efficacy performed for each clinical indication sought in order to be sure of having enough patients with the resistant bacteria under investigation and to demonstrate that the new antibiotic is not inferior to comparable antibacterial drugs. These issues mean that the costs of carrying out a clinical trial on a new antibiotic are extremely high.At the same time, because some antibiotics will only be used on a very small number of patients, the costs of development often exceed the potential return on investment. In other words, antibiotic development is simply no longer a financially viable option for pharmaceutical companies, and just a handful of pharmaceutical companies remain in the field.If no action is taken to address these issues, we risk leaving society in a situation where doctors will have few, if any, options to treat resistant bacterial infections. To avoid a public health emergency, the entire antibiotic research community, including researchers in universities, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and pharmaceutical companies must work together to reinvigorate research into new antibiotics. As a public-private partnership (PPP), IMI is the ideal platform to launch such an initiative.In its Action Plan against the rising threats from Antimicrobial Resistance of November 2011, the European Commission called for ‘unprecedented collaborative research and development efforts to bring new antibiotics to patients’ by, among other things, launching an IMI programme ‘for research on new antibiotics aimed at improving the efficiency of research and development of new antibiotics through unprecedented open sharing of knowledge’.The result is the New Drugs for Bad Bugs (ND4BB) programme, which includes the COMBACTE project.COMBACTE – improving clinical trials for antibioticsThe COMBACTE project focuses on addressing the barriers to clinical development. A key outcome of the project will be a high quality, pan-European clinical trial network. Dubbed COMBACTE CLIN-Net, it will be capable of recruiting sufficient patients into multinational trials at all stages of development. Alongside this, the project will also establish a pan-European laboratory network (COMBACTE LAB-Net), which will deliver epidemiological information and data from microbial surveillance work to guide the selection of clinical trial sites. Crucially, the COMBACTE team aims to generate innovative trial designs to facilitate the registration of novel antibacterial agents. It will also design and validate tests to support the diagnosis of patients, identify the most appropriate treatments, and monitor the patient’s response.A large part of the project will be devoted to the performance of clinical trials of drugs under development in the pharmaceutical companies involved in the project. The first antibiotic to undergo clinical trials under COMBACTE is GSK1322322, which inhibits the action of a bacterial enzyme called peptide deformylase (PDF) and appears to be effective against multi-drug resistant respiratory and skin pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Most importantly, GSK1322322 represents a new class of antibiotics with a novel mode of action. In COMBACTE, experts will run clinical trials to evaluate GSK1322322’s efficacy at treating acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.The second compound to be tested will be MEDI4893, which is designed to prevent S. aureus disease by neutralising a specific toxin produced by the bug which is behind much of the tissue and organ damage associated with S. aureus infections. Considering the importance of S. aureus as a human pathogen and the extensive problems with antibiotic resistance, MEDI489 represents an attractive preventive measure for patients at high risk of S. aureus infections. Early clinical trials will evaluate the efficacy and safety of MEDI4893 at preventing infections in patients at risk of S. aureus surgical site infections and mechanically-ventilated patients at risk for S. aureus pneumonia. Finally, to support more broadly the clinical development of new treatments for S. aureus, the consortium will gather new data on hospital-associated infections by carrying out epidemiological surveillance among surgical and intensive care unit (ICU) patients across Europe. This will help to assess the impact of patient-related and other factors on the incidence of surgical site infections and ICU pneumonia to identify the patient subgroups that are at an increased risk of these infections.Hope for the futureThe challenge of antimicrobial development is so great that no organisation could take it on alone. By bringing together leading experts from universities, hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies who are skilled in microbiology, epidemiology, drug development, and clinical trial design, COMBACTE is set to give antibiotic development in Europe a major boost.Unique in its scale, ambition, and its potential benefits for patients, public health and pharmaceutical research in Europe, COMBACTE has the potential to become the powerhouse of antimicrobial drug development in Europe that could serve as a standard for other groups. Ultimately, the hope is that COMBACTE will provide a framework for the rapid and efficient development of new treatments as well as diagnostic tests that can be speedily commercialised for use on the patients that so urgently need them.","Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Da Volterra SAS, Paris, France:Glaxosmithkline Research And Development LTD., Brentford, Middlesex, United Kingdom:Janssen Pharmaceutica Nv, Beerse, Belgium:Pfizer Limited, Sandwich, Kent , United Kingdom:The Medicines Company, Parsippany, United States ","AO Documentation and Publishing Foundation, Clinical Investigation and Documentation, Davos, Switzerland:CHU de Pointe-à-Pitre, Pointe-à-Pitre, France:Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de LIMOGES, Limoges, France:Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Brussels, Belgium:Consorci Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain:Eberhard Karls Universitaet Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany:Ecrin European Clinical Research Infrastructure Network, Paris, France:Erasmus Universitair Medisch Centrum Rotterdam, Rotterdam, Netherlands:Ernst Moritz Arndt University Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany:Ethniko Kai Kapodistriako Panepistimio Athinon, Athens, Greece:European Forum For Good Clinical Practice, Brussels, Belgium:Fondazione Irccs Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy:Fundacion Privada Instituto De Salud Global Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain:Helmholtz-Zentrum Fuer Infektionsforschung GMBH, Braunschweig, Germany:Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, Paris, France:Instituto Nacional De Saude Dr. Ricardo Jorge, Lisbon, Portugal:Klinikum Der Universitaet Zu Koeln, Cologne, Germany:Linkopings Universitet, Linkoping, Sweden:North Bristol National Health Service Trust, Bristol, United Kingdom:Servicio Andaluz De Salud, Sevilla, Spain:Servicio Madrileno De Salud, Madrid, Spain:Tel Aviv Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel:Universitaetsklinikum Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany:Universitair Medisch Centrum Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands:Universitat Zurich, Zürich, Switzerland:Universite De Geneve, Genève 4, Switzerland:Universite Lyon 1 Claude Bernard, Villeurbanne, France:Universiteit Antwerpen, Antwerp, Belgium","Julius Clinical Research BV, Zeist, Netherlands","Hospital Clinico Y Provincial De Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain:Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany:TWINCORE GmbH, Hannover, Germany:Universitair Ziekenhuis Antwerpen, Edegem, Belgium:Universite Paris Diderot - Paris 7, Paris, France",,"AO Documentation and Publishing Foundation, Clinical Investigation and Documentation:57 934:Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de LIMOGES:48 977 229:CHRU of Besançon (left the project):4 380:CHU de Pointe-à-Pitre:39 614:Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc:719 243:Consorci Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer:45 928:Eberhard Karls Universitaet Tuebingen:1 018 710:Erasmus Universitair Medisch Centrum Rotterdam:1 136 553:Ernst Moritz Arndt University Greifswald:870 128:Ethniko Kai Kapodistriako Panepistimio Athinon:57 934:European Forum For Good Clinical Practice:100 000:Fondazione Irccs Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico:57 934:Fundacion Privada Instituto De Salud Global Barcelona:862 572:Helmholtz-Zentrum Fuer Infektionsforschung GMBH:1 087 837:Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale:808 143:Instituto Nacional De Saude Dr. Ricardo Jorge:57 934:Julius Clinical Research BV:1 567 067:Klinikum Der Universitaet Zu Koeln:2 428 336:Linkopings Universitet:57 934:North Bristol National Health Service Trust:1 184 970:Servicio Andaluz De Salud:1 179 018:Servicio Madrileno De Salud:228 934:Tel Aviv Medical Center:57 934:Universitaetsklinikum Freiburg:509 217:Universitair Medisch Centrum Utrecht:30 784 817:Universitat Zurich:240 766:Universite De Geneve:5 167 190:Universite Joseph Fourier - Grenoble 1 (left the project):5 918:Universite Lyon 1 Claude Bernard:858 140:Universiteit Antwerpen:8 346 129:Hospital Clinico Y Provincial De Barcelona:129 006:Medizinische Hochschule Hannover:131 285:TWINCORE GmbH:543 516:Universitair Ziekenhuis Antwerpen:23 250:Universite Paris Diderot - Paris 7:87 510:Total Cost:109 433 010",https://www.combacte.com/about/about-combacte-net-detail/,#N/A,#N/A,"Hasan Jafri,

COMPACT,,,SAD,Closed,01/11/2012,31/10/2017,IMI1,4,Group Cross,Collaboration on the optimisation of macromolecular pharmaceutical access to cellular targets,Biologicals:Drug delivery,RIA (Research and Innovation Action),115363,10 184 909,16 561 578,,3 237 243,"Many new medicines are based on biological molecules such as proteins, peptides or nucleic acids. The goal of the COMPACT project was to shed new light on the obstacles these drugs (which are known as biopharmaceuticals) need to overcome to get to where they are needed in the body. As a result, the project has delivered drug delivery prototypes which may lead to the next generation of biologics-based medicines. The project also generated a spin-out company and two patents, demonstrating concrete socio-economic benefits.
Biopharmaceuticals, medicines based on biological molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids, have already delivered effective treatments for a number of serious, often hard to treat diseases, such as Crohn’s disease and multiple sclerosis, dramatically improving patients’ quality of life.The pharmaceutical industry is keen to expand its work on these novel drugs, but biopharmaceuticals still have a number of drawbacks which are hampering their broader application. For example, because these molecules tend to be complex and delicate, most biopharmaceuticals have to be injected; if they were administered orally (a more patient-friendly route), they would be destroyed by the harsh environment of the stomach. Furthermore, even once biopharmaceuticals are in the body, their large size means it is hard for them to get to their molecular targets.By bringing together 14 academic groups, 7 pharmaceutical companies and 2 SMEs, the COMPACT project set out to reduce delivery and targeting bottlenecks for developing innovative biopharmaceuticals.Better understanding of nanomedicinesOne of the most significant project achievements is related to getting biopharmaceuticals from the injection site to the target that is causing the disease. For that purpose, researchers use nanocarriers, modifying their surface so that they bind to specific cells. COMPACT researchers discovered why this modification works in certain cases and not in others, which led to a better understanding of how nanomedicines work. The project also developed a novel nanoparticle to get a new type of therapeutic oligonucleotide into the lungs via inhalation.More patient-friendly ways of administering drugsAnother important project outcome has to do with making the delivery systems for biological molecules more patient friendly. For example, insulin is a very effective treatment for diabetes but it has to be administered via injections. The COMPACT project researchers investigated whether insulin and similar biologicals could be delivered via tablets, which would be a more patient-friendly route. They showed that when insulin is taken via oral delivery, certain cell penetrating peptides can help in getting the molecules over the intestinal barrier into the blood. This represents the first important step towards the oral delivery of biological molecules.Additionally, the project developed microneedles which can deliver peptides directly into the skin using a nanomedicine type of approach. These microneedles are so fine that they dissolve after they are inserted into the skin, representing a more patient-friendly alternative to traditional injections.Important breakthrough in the blood-brain barrierAnother important achievement concerns the blood-brain barrier. The brain is a really isolated organ as there is a tight barrier between the blood and the brain cells. Getting across this barrier is a huge limitation in drug delivery. In this project, researchers identified potential new targets that can be used to get drugs into the brain. This is only at the target identification level at this stage but has led to a new IMI project which will explore those possibilities in more detail.Database, cell banks and other achievementsOther important project achievements include:a wide repertoire of drug delivery systems, fully characterised and tested;in vitro and in vivo tools to study delivery, including transgenic reporter mice;a manually curated database containing over 1 200 entries with useful searchable information from the scientific literature on nonlipid nanoparticles and neurotrophic viruses;cell banks containing the most relevant cell lines and standardised protocols and a serum source to be used by all the partners throughout the consortium;a strong network of industry and academia to further explore collaborations via bilateral agreements and European funding.Socio-economic benefitsIn addition to the scientific achievements, the project generated significant socio-economic benefits. For example, during the course of the project two patents were filed: one for brain delivery and another for the nanocarrier system for lung delivery.In order to build on the project achievements, a biotech company has also spun out from Oxford University. The company will look into developing exosomes –nano-sized lipid vesicles which shuttle proteins and genetic information between cells for the delivery of oligonucleotide-based therapeutics. The system is still at an early stage, but once developed, could be of great interest for pharmaceutical companies.Furthermore, several companies which were not part of COMPACT are now also showing interest in the delivery systems developed within the project. They are collaborating with some of the COMPACT academic partners to see if these delivery systems could be used for their therapeutics. In the long run, these new collaborations could lead to the development of a new line of therapeutics.For the benefit of industry, academia, SMEsFor academic partners this project was a great opportunity to work with the industry, use their R&D infrastructure, and learn what kinds of problems they encounter during the drug development process. The project also contributed to training of a new generation of pharmaceutical scientists that have a better understanding of the needs and limitations of the drug development process. During the course of the project, 19 PhD students got their doctorate degrees and 5  found jobs at the companies of industry partners.The pharmaceutical companies benefitted from being able to test novel nanocarrier based delivery approaches directly with academic partners. They also benefitted from the network that has been created within the project, not just with academic partners and SMEs but also with other key players in industry.The SMEs in the project benefitted from access to industry knowledge and resources, getting a close-up view of the drug development process, and from being treated as an equal partner in the project.Benefits for patientsBiopharmaceuticals have the potential to improve the lives of many patients with diseases and conditions that are currently hard or even impossible to treat. By finding more effective ways of administering these drugs, and improving their ability to travel through the body to where they are needed, the COMPACT project outcomes will allow more patients to benefit from biopharmaceuticals. Furthermore, designing less invasive administration routes and reducing the dose (and therefore the side effects) and frequency of administration will help to improve patient compliance with treatments.What’s nextThe project resulted in both tangible and non-tangible assets that will be useful for further research. Among the tangible assets are the transgenic mice for analysing biodistribution of nanocarrier systems. These are already accessible to researchers through a commercial company.Non-tangible assets include more than 65 publications and the know-how that has been generated and will be further developed by researchers in the field, including those in follow-on IMI projects.Interview with project coordinators","Abbvie Deutschland GMBH & Co Kg, Wiesbaden, Germany:Boehringer Ingelheim Internationalgmbh, Ingelheim, Germany:Glaxosmithkline Research And Development LTD., Brentford, Middlesex, United Kingdom:Merck Kommanditgesellschaft Auf Aktien, Darmstadt, Germany:Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark:Pfizer Limited, Sandwich, Kent , United Kingdom:Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GMBH, Frankfurt / Main, Germany","Bioneer A/S, Horsholm, Denmark:Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom:Helmholtz-Zentrum Fuer Infektionsforschung GMBH, Braunschweig, Germany:Kobenhavns Universitet, Copenhagen, Denmark:Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Muenchen, Munich, Germany:Norges teknisk-naturvitenskapelige universitet - NTNU, Trondheim, Norway:Stockholms Universitet, Stockholm, Sweden:Universitat Wien, Vienna, Austria:Universitat Zurich, Zürich, Switzerland:Universiteit Gent, Gent, Belgium:Universiteit Leiden, Leiden, Netherlands:Universiteit Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands:University of Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland:University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom","Pharmacoidea Fejleszto Es Szolgaltato Kft, Szeged, Hungary",,,Bioneer A/S:487 563:Cardiff University:675 228:Helmholtz-Zentrum Fuer Infektionsforschung GMBH:550 611:Kobenhavns Universitet:984 291:Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Muenchen:201 594:Norges teknisk-naturvitenskapelige universitet - NTNU:491 014:Pharmacoidea Fejleszto Es Szolgaltato Kft:559 740:Stockholms Universitet:618 030:Universitat Wien:837 742:Universitat Zurich:612 981:Universiteit Gent:491 133:Universiteit Leiden:786 582:Universiteit Utrecht:1 712 509:University of Helsinki:444 273:University of Oxford:731 618:Total Cost:10 184 909,https://www.combacte.com/about/about-combacte-net-detail/,?,"IMI: Magda Gunn

The DDMoRe project developed common standards and tools to allow scientists to share their models with each other. The project also developed a model repository, the largest of its kind to date, which enables access to curated and shared knowledge for the benefit of model-informed drug discovery. The project outputs are already speeding up the drug development process, while at the same time making it more transparent and collaborative. Furthermore, at least three spin-offs were created during the project, demonstrating concrete socio-economic benefits.Model informed-drug development (MIDD) is acknowledged as a vital approach in understanding drug-related benefits and risks. At the core of MIDD lies modelling and simulation (M&S), a technology providing the basis for informed, quantitative decision-making. M&S facilitates the continuous integration of information related to a drug or disease into constantly evolving mathematical models that are capable of describing and predicting the behaviour of systems. As such, M&S helps researchers, regulators and public health care bodies to answer the questions they face when bringing drugs to patients. The full adoption of MIDD is hindered by a lack of common tools, languages and ontologies, which often leads to inefficient reuse of data and duplication of effort by academic, industrial and regulatory stakeholders. IMI’s DDMoRe project set out to address that challenge.The project’s main achievement was the development of a repository for clinical trial data models, the largest of its kind to date, which members of the modelling community can use to store and access an assortment of computational models. The repository is publicly available and contains more than 120 models so far.As different models are executed in different software programmes, this may cause model structures to be very different too. In order to address this, DDMoRe also designed a set of common standards for developing, describing and storing models. These standards are now also available for everyone to use and are facilitating model sharing and communication between researchers.An interoperability frameworkAdditionally, the project developed an interoperability framework in which scientists can perform a modelling exercise. The framework is free for anyone to download and enables scientists to re-run models, thereby replicating each other’s work. The framework uses new standards and connectors for many commonly used programming tools and languages. As such, the interoperability framework provides a consistent environment in which researchers can work, using modelling tools they know, while opening up their work to others through a standard language for describing models.Training programme and other achievementsOther important project achievements include:The development of computer models in different therapeutic areas such as oncology and diabetes;a training programme to support the adoption of the standards, repository and the interoperability framework;new tools which enable scientists to build and evaluate models and use them for specific purposes, such as optimising clinical trials.For the benefit of industry, academia and SMEsThanks to their participation in this project, the academic community gained access and insights into industry bottlenecks, which helped them to develop methods and models which are useful for drug development. Additionally, as part of the project, many PhD students received invaluable training and access to industry, and many of them landed jobs in the industry.When it comes to the industry, model-informed approaches have become very important in designing clinical trials and other stages of drug development. The interoperability framework, standards and model repository have already and will further enhance the way industry implements model-informed drug development projects.SMEs within the project benefited from expanding their customer base and gaining insights into their customers’ needs. Additionally, three SME spin-offs were created as a direct result of the project.What’s nextBefore the project ended, the DDMoRe project partners set up a foundation, which is continuing some of the work. The foundation is now the primary caretaker of all important project outputs including the repository, the interoperability framework and the data standards.Read the interview with project coordinators","Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Basingstoke, United Kingdom:F.

DIRECT,"(Mark Ibberson, Vassilios Ioannidis)?",,SAD,completing before August 2020,01/02/2012,31/07/2019,IMI1,3,Group Chronic diseases,Diabetes research on patient stratification,Diabetes & metabolic disorders:Disease taxonomy,RIA (Research and Innovation Action),115317,21 388 643,18 816 527,,6 560 026,"Type 2 diabetes patients are a diverse group; in some, the disease progresses rapidly, while in others it takes a slower course. Similarly, a treatment that works well in one patient may prove less effective in another. This has led researchers to acknowledge that there are actually a number of different subtypes of type 2 diabetes. The goal of the IMI-funded DIRECT project is to identify these subtypes and determine most appropriate treatments for them. The project brings together Europe’s leading researchers from academia, healthcare, and the pharmaceutical industry.
Some 285 million people worldwide have type 2 diabetes, and that figure is set to rise to 439 million by 2030. It arises when the body cannot make enough insulin (the hormone responsible for managing blood sugar levels), or when the body fails to respond to insulin. Although type 2 diabetes is a chronic, lifelong condition, it can be managed through a combination of medicines and lifestyle changes. If left unmanaged, patients’ blood sugar levels become too high, triggering damage to the cardiovascular system, kidneys, eyes, and nerve endings.
Although there are a number of risk factors for type 2 diabetes (such as obesity), it is not always clear why some people develop the condition while others do not. Furthermore, the course of the disease and the effectiveness of different medicines vary from one patient to another. In other words, there are a number of different kinds of type 2 diabetes, and that is where the DIRECT project comes in.Variations on a theme
The focus of the DIRECT project is patient stratification, which involves identifying different subgroups of patients. The project will develop and validate tests to predict who will get diabetes, whose condition will deteriorate rapidly after diagnosis, and who will respond well or badly to certain drugs. The tests will then allow the DIRECT project to determine which existing drugs are effective for different varieties of type 2 diabetes.
DIRECT will gather large amounts of data as well as samples from people at risk of diabetes, people with diabetes, and people undergoing diabetes treatment. This will enable the project team to identify biomarkers (biological markers such as the level of a certain molecule in the blood) associated with different subtypes of type 2 diabetes and different rates of disease progression. These biomarkers will then be tested in prospective clinical trials, paving the way for their use as new diagnostic tests as well as in the creation of personalised therapies. Getting the right treatments to the right patients.
The tests developed by DIRECT will ultimately usher in a new era of personalised medicine for diabetes patients. In practice, this means doctors will be able to diagnose their patients more accurately and tailor treatments to suit their own particular subtype of type 2 diabetes. In this way, patients will be able to manage their condition more effectively and hopefully avoid the complications associated with diabetes. Furthermore, patients who are at risk of diabetes could be identified and monitored.A boost for the drug development sector
The work carried out under the DIRECT project will substantially boost industry’s understanding of the underlying causes of type 2 diabetes, helping it to develop tailored treatments that can be targeted to the right patients.Pieces of a pharma puzzle
The work carried out in DIRECT complements the efforts of IMI’s other diabetes projects. IMIDIA (‘Improving beta-cell function and identification of diagnostic biomarkers for treatment monitoring in diabetes’) is studying the beta cells of the pancreas, which are responsible for producing insulin, with a view to developing a cure for diabetes. Meanwhile SUMMIT (‘Surrogate markers for micro- and macro-vascular hard endpoints for innovative diabetes tools’) is developing tools to identify the patients at greatest risk of developing complications relating to diabetes.","Boehringer Ingelheim Internationalgmbh, Ingelheim, Germany:Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Basingstoke, United Kingdom:Institut De Recherches Internationales Servier, Suresnes, France:Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark:Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GMBH, Frankfurt / Main, Germany","Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden, Leiden, Netherlands:Centre Hospitalier Regional Et Universitaire De Lille, Lille, France:Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, Paris, France:Consiglio Nazionale Delle Ricerche, Roma, Italy:Consorci Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain:Danmarks Tekniske Universitet, Kgs.

The challenge for the entire vaccine research and healthcare community is to evaluate the effectiveness of these annual vaccines. Current efforts in this area are simply not extensive enough to assess in detail the benefits of vaccination for different groups and to guide public health measures during a flu season. One element hampering efforts to carry out more extensive vaccine effectiveness is the ability of the different stakeholders involved to work in collaboration.The goal of the DRIVE project is to set up a platform, bringing together all stakeholders, to study brand-specific flu vaccine effectiveness in the EU over a five-year period. At the heart of the platform will be a governance framework that allows transparent and efficient collaboration between public and private stakeholders. To guarantee the scientific independence of the studies, the roles of all participants, including vaccine manufacturers, will be clearly defined and traceable.

On the one hand, we urgently need new antibiotics to treat resistant infections. At the same time, the use of new antibiotics should be restricted, so as to minimise the risk of bacteria developing resistance to them. As a result of this situation, the potential return on investment is much lower than in most other medical fields. DRIVE-AB is developing concrete recommendations for new economic models that would provide industry with an incentive to invest in this area while reconciling this with the need to use new antibiotics wisely.
Antibiotic resistance (ABR) represents a serious and growing threat to human and animal health worldwide. In the EU alone, ABR is responsible for some 25 000 deaths every year, and the annual treatment and social costs have been estimated at some €1.5 billion. Meanwhile, new forms of resistance continue to arise and spread, leaving clinicians with few weapons to bring infections under control. Yet despite the recognised need for new antibiotics, the reality is that only two new classes of antibiotics have been brought to the market in the last three decades.The reasons for this are manifold. On the scientific front, there is an urgent need for a greater understanding of how antibiotics work. In the regulatory arena, running clinical trials on new antibiotics is extremely challenging and costly. However, efforts to develop new antibiotics are also hampered by economics.When bacteria are exposed to a new antibiotic, there is a risk that they will develop resistance. Therefore, new antibiotics should only be used when absolutely necessary, and ‘wise’ or ‘responsible’ use of antibiotics in both humans and animals represents a key aspect of wider efforts to tackle the spread of AMR. This means that sales of new antibiotics should be low, and as a result, the costs of development often exceed any potential return on investment. In other words, antibiotic development is simply no longer a financially viable option for large pharmaceutical companies, and only a few of such companies remain focused on this field.Reconciling responsible use and economic incentivesDRIVE-AB’s goal is to design the building blocks of an innovative economic model that simultaneously incentivises the development of new antibiotics while ensuring they are used wisely.One of the first tasks of the project is to deliver an evidence-based, consensus definition of ‘responsible antibiotic use’. They will also use data from surveillance systems, antibiotic prescription databases, and the scientific literature to estimate the current burden of ABR from clinical and economic standpoints. This information will feed into simulation models designed to estimate how ABR will impact on future public health needs in a range of socio-economic settings. These resources will enable the project team to devise valuation models capable of estimating the true value of new and existing antibiotics from the perspectives of patients, physicians, payers, and society as a whole.The team will draw on all of these resources to generate alternative economic strategies and reward models that are in line with the project’s objective of promoting wise antibiotic use, incentivising antibiotic development, and ensuring access to all patients in need. The models will be tested extensively, and the most promising ones will be analysed, tested and explored in detail in collaboration with a multidisciplinary platform that brings together key stakeholders concerned about this issue.At the end of the project, the strongest models and their implementation strategies will be presented at a stakeholder conference. The project is also committed to communicating its outcomes to governments and policymakers worldwide.A strong teamThe DRIVE-AB project brings together partners from academia and large pharmaceutical companies, with expertise in ABR, education and campaigning, health economics, health policy, political science, entrepreneurship, and pricing and market access. As such it is well placed to deliver solutions to the economic part of the puzzle of tackling ABR.","Astellas Pharma Europe LTD, Chertsey, United Kingdom:Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:F.

The goal of EBiSC is to establish a European iPS cell bank that will be the ‘go-to’ resource for the characterisation, storage and distribution of high quality iPS cells. Ultimately, EBiSC will become an independent organisation, distributing high quality iPS cells on a not-for-profit basis to scientists worldwide.
Stem cells in the spotlightMost adult cells can only divide to produce other cells of the same type – for example, skin cells can only make other skin cells, and blood cells can only make other blood cells. In contrast, embryonic stem cells are ‘pluripotent’, i.e. able to give rise to all the different kinds of cell that make up the human body. However, researchers are now able to reprogramme ordinary adult cells to create so-called induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Like embryonic stem cells, iPS cells are able to generate any kind of cell; as such, they offer researchers a good supply of different kinds of human cell that can be used in research and drug development.For example, iPS cells can be used to study disease biology, identify markers of disease and potential drug targets, and test drug safety and efficacy. In addition, iPS cells help to reduce the use of animals in research.This is a relatively new technology – the first iPS cells were only created in 2006 (a feat that won their inventor a Nobel prize). Since then, scientists worldwide have created hundreds of human iPS cell lines and some cell banks have been set up. However, the quality of these lines varies enormously (some may not even be pluripotent), and few lines are accompanied by sufficient clinical and other data to ensure that researchers are using the right cell for their needs. Finally, access to these cell lines is often tightly restricted. For this reason, demand for high quality, well characterised iPS cells vastly outstrips supply.Europe’s go-to resource for iPS cellsEBiSC’s goal is to establish a centralised facility where academics, biotech companies, and big pharmaceutical companies can store and access high-quality, well-characterised iPS cells covering a range of disease areas as well as cells from healthy donors. For its part, the bank will provide standardised protocols for the storage, retrieval, culture, and differentiation into different cells types, plus a searchable catalogue where cells can be requested based on specific characteristics or disease areas. Samples of the cell lines in the catalogue will be shipped to scientists around the world.The main processing and storage facility will be operated by Roslin Cells at the Babraham Research Campus in Cambridge, UK, while the distribution of the cell lines will be coordinated by Public Health England’s European Cell Culture Collection (ECACC). The project partners themselves will generate and deposit the first lines to the bank, but the project will also recieve deposits from other projects and organisations, including IMI projects working in this area. The storage facility in Cambridge will accommodate many thousands of cell lines, and additional storage capacity is available at the Fraunhofer Institute for Biomedical Engineering in Germany.On the business side, once the initial collection of cell lines is in place, the project will quickly start distributing cells to the scientific community. The project will then scale up its activities to become fully operational by 2016, having in excess of 1 000 lines in its catalogue.. The objective is for the initiative to be self-sustaining financially by 2019 and become an independent legal entity, distributing iPS cells worldwide on a not-for-profit basis.A focus on excellenceIn addition to its business objectives, EBiSC has the goal of becoming a centre of excellence for applied scientific excellence, by leading the way in the use and development of the most advanced methods for characterising, processing, storing and distributing iPS cells. In addition to experts in stem cell biology and banking, the project includes leaders in fields such as data management, law and social sciences. This will ensure that cells sent out by EBiSC are of a high quality from a scientific point of view and that their use is in line with relevant ethical requirements.Benefits for allBy standardising procedures and ensuring the quality of the cell lines and associated data, EBiSC will help academic and clinical researchers shed new light on the biology of diverse diseases. For the pharmaceutical efficiency, the cell lines will represent an important tool for carrying out early stage drug testing. For patients, the project represents an important step in ensuring that iPS cells realise their potential as a tool to improve and speed up the development of better and safer treatments.","Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, Leverkusen, Germany:Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Basingstoke, United Kingdom:H.

Deployment of and compliance with vaccination regimensFor a vaccine to have a real impact on an outbreak, high levels of vaccination coverage are essential. In addition, for lasting protection, two doses of the vaccine may be needed. However, the stigma surrounding Ebola, coupled with a suspicion of vaccines in general, could deter many people from getting vaccinated. Strong communication campaigns are therefore needed to address these challenges.The EBODAC project is developing a communication strategy and tools to promote the acceptance and uptake of new Ebola vaccines.

The programme complements work being carried out with the support of other funding bodies. In addition to Ebola, the programme will also address related diseases, such as Marburg.About Ebolaand related diseasesEbola virus disease (EVD), previously known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is a rare and deadly disease caused by infection with one of the Ebola virus strains. The virus spreads in the human population through direct human-to-human contact with the bodily fluids of infected patients who are showing symptoms. It has an incubation period of 2-21 days, and it usually begins with flu-like symptoms, but rapidly progresses to multiple organ failure and blood-clotting abnormalities which manifest as internal and external haemorrhages (bleeding). It is fatal in between 25% and 90% of cases. There is currently no licensed treatment against EVD, and the development of treatments and preventive measures such as vaccines is hampered by challenges including manufacturing-related hurdles, the stability of vaccines during transport and storage, vaccine deployment, and the time taken to diagnose cases of EVD.Ebola is a member of the filovirus family of viruses, which also includes Marburg virus. Like Ebola, Marburg causes cause severe, often fatal haemorrhagic fever in humans and other primates (monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees), and like Ebola, it is transmitted directly from one person to another. (In contrast, other viruses that cause haemorrhagic fevers are spread via intermediate hosts - for example, dengue fever is transmitted by mosquitoes.) There is no specific treatment or vaccine against Marburg haemorrhagic fever.The 2014-15 Ebola epidemic was unprecedented in its scale and geographical distribution.

Relatively few manufacturers have the biosafety rating required for the manufacture of Ebola vaccines, and this is slowing down the production of vaccine candidates.The focus of the EBOMAN project is on accelerating the development and manufacturing of a ‘prime-boost’ Ebola vaccine regimen (Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo) in development at the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. In the short term, this will ensure the delivery of sufficient quantities of the Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo vaccine regimen to support the two EBOVAC projects to perform the clinical trials. In parallel, this project will create additional vaccine production capacity to allow for the rapid preparation of large quantities of vaccines.A part of the Ebola+ ProgrammeThe IMI Ebola+ programme was launched in response to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak that started in western Africa in 2014. The comprehensive programme contributes to efforts to tackle a wide range of challenges in Ebola research, including vaccines development, clinical trials, and transport, as well as diagnostics. The programme complements work being carried out with the support of other funding bodies. In addition to Ebola, the programme will also address related diseases, such as Marburg.About Ebolaand related diseasesEbola virus disease (EVD), previously known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is a rare and deadly disease caused by infection with one of the Ebola virus strains. The virus spreads in the human population through direct human-to-human contact with the bodily fluids of infected patients who are showing symptoms. It has an incubation period of 2-21 days, and it usually begins with flu-like symptoms, but rapidly progresses to multiple organ failure and blood-clotting abnormalities which manifest as internal and external haemorrhages (bleeding). It is fatal in between 25% and 90% of cases. There is currently no licensed treatment against EVD, and the development of treatments and preventive measures such as vaccines is hampered by challenges including manufacturing-related hurdles, the stability of vaccines during transport and storage, vaccine deployment, and the time taken to diagnose cases of EVD.Ebola is a member of the filovirus family of viruses, which also includes Marburg virus. Like Ebola, Marburg causes cause severe, often fatal haemorrhagic fever in humans and other primates (monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees), and like Ebola, it is transmitted directly from one person to another. (In contrast, other viruses that cause haemorrhagic fevers are spread via intermediate hosts - for example, dengue fever is transmitted by mosquitoes.) There is no specific treatment or vaccine against Marburg haemorrhagic fever.The 2014-15 Ebola epidemic was unprecedented in its scale and geographical distribution. By the middle of 2015, World Health Organization (WHO) statistics recorded over 27 000 cases and 11 000 deaths from the disease, most of them in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The epidemic highlighted the need for research into better vaccines, diagnostics and treatments to stop future epidemics in their tracks.","Janssen Vaccines & Prevention BV, Leiden, Netherlands","Vibalogics GMBH, Cuxhaven, Germany","Bavarian Nordic As, Kvistgaard, Denmark",,,Vibalogics GMBH:1 023 325:Total Cost:1 023 325,https://www.ebovac.org/eboman/,Yes,"IMI: Hugh Laverty

There is a growing realization that the development and integration of Electronic Health Record systems (EHRs) for medical research can:


	enable substantial efficiency gains
	make Europe more attractive for R&D investment
	provide patients better access to innovative medicines and improved health outcomes.

EHRs can now be designed to seamlessly integrate with existing research platforms and healthcare networks to create opportunities for many stakeholders, including the pharmaceutical and bio-pharma industries.However, key challenges are compliance with various ethical, legal and privacy requirements (and acceptance by the general public, patients, and medical professionals), providing a platform that works across many EHR systems and is sustainable within a scalable business model. A 4-year project, EHR4CR will involve a team of recognised European academic and industrial partners.The project will build a platform to enable the use of EHR for more efficient medical research and run pilots (on interoperability, security, data quality, data storage solutions, organisational issues,accreditation and certification, etc) to demonstrate the viability and scalability of an EHR4CR business model.The EHR4CR project supports the IMI strategic agenda with an information gateway solution to enhance clinical research efficiency and innovation. A key IMI aspect is the development of a knowledge management capability that can, for example, provide information management support for other research on personalized medicines, now an IMI 2010 call topic. EHR4CR also supports other IMI R&D projects by enabling the use (and reuse) of large amounts of health data – in an ethical and cost-effective way.The EHR4CR project consortium draws its expert partners from academia, with 20 organisations and 4 SMEs working with 10 EFPIA companies and is an example of the scale of collaboration made possible through IMI.","Amgen, Brussels, Belgium:Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Bayer Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany:Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Basingstoke, United Kingdom:F.

Comprising a collection of up to half a million compounds (derived from new public and existing private company collections) and a screening centre, the European Lead Factory offers researchers in academia, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and patient organisations an unprecedented opportunity to advance medical research and develop new medicines.
A key tool in the earlier stages of drug development is a technique called High Throughput Screening (HTS), in which researchers screen large collections of chemical compounds in the hunt for molecules that could be potential drugs or be used in drug development in other ways. Although pharmaceutical companies have built up large libraries of compounds over the years, access to these collections has been tightly restricted to in-house use by the owners.Meanwhile, the academic community is becoming increasingly interested in HTS, but public compound collections tend to be rather small and expertise in the area is scattered across many institutions. As a result, few public drug targets have been screened against large, high-quality compound libraries. This has hampered efforts to generate promising leads for the development of innovative drugs.A unique resourceEnter the European Lead Factory, which provides any researcher in European universities, SMEs and patient organisations with the opportunity to access an industry-like platform for the identification of ‘hits’. Hits are compounds that could potentially be developed into new medicines.The Joint European Compound Library (JECL) forms the core of the European Lead Factory. The pharmaceutical companies in the consortium have contributed a total of over 300 000 compounds to the project from their proprietary collections. In addition, up to 200 000 novel compounds are being added to the JECL from the project’s own synthetic chemistry programme, the Public Compound Collection (PCC). Chemical library design proposals are sourced from both the European Lead Factory consortium members and from external academics/SMEs. Proposals are selected based on criteria such as novelty, diversity potential, innovative design and synthetic tractability. Once approved, the project’s SMEs, together with the academic institutions, seamlessly translate the most compelling ideas into high quality compound libraries to be shipped to the consortium’s HTS facilities. The JECL forms a unique set of tractable compounds that are not commercially available. They are designed to provide versatile starting points and ample opportunities for further chemical exploration and growth during the hit-to-lead phase.The European Screening Centre executes the HTS services for the selected public projects from academia and SMEs. It also handles all logistics for the Joint European Compound Collection, acting as a neutral, ‘honest’ broker in the transfer, handling and analysis of confidential data.Anybody, any target, any diseaseThe European Lead Factory is open to drug target programmes related to all human disease areas and all types of defined molecular targets. Any researcher from European academia or an SME can access the Joint European Compound Library for screening through the European Screening Centre by submitting their proposal.Public programmes selected by the project are further advanced by the European Lead Factory. Experts from the project provide guidance in the design of the experiments, support on medicinal chemistry, and help setting up partnerships with others if needed. Once the HTS has been run, the ‘target owner’ (i.e. the organisation that submitted the target for inclusion in the project) will receive a list of a maximum of 50 compounds that have been identified. The large pharmaceutical companies that are partners in the project also have access to the project’s facilities for a defined number of targets under the same conditions.Strength in diversityThe European Lead Factory unites bright ideas, talent and experience. It combines the power of the pharmaceutical industry’s previously inaccessible compound libraries with the innovation of the academic communities in designing novel compounds and the expertise of many SMEs in HTS and library generation. Importantly, it provides a screening platform of industrial quality focused on value generation. Looking to the future, the European Lead Factory is fast becoming a centre of excellence in Europe for small molecule drug discovery programmes in the public sector. A key output of the project is a comprehensive business plan that will ensure the viability of the initiative once the initial IMI project has ended.","Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, Leverkusen, Germany:H.

To provide a focus and guidance for the development of the framework, the project will focus initially on questions relating to obesity and Alzheimer’s disease.
Difficulties with dataRecent years have seen an explosion in the number of databases containing medical and research data, from Electronic Health Records (EHRs), cohort studies (in which a group of individuals are followed for a number of years), disease-specific studies, and biobanks, to name a few. Because this data is scattered across diverse platforms, it cannot be fully exploited. Linking up the data would allow scientists to significantly advance medical research and drug development.However, in practice, this is rather difficult. Not only is the data fragmented, differences in coding systems and languages, plus legal and ethical restraints, hamper efforts to combine these sources of data. Furthermore, there are often information gaps.There is therefore a need for a single system that allows researchers to link data on an immense scale, including patient health records, research data, survey and administrative data, imaging, social, environmental and economic data. Such a system should also be able to bring together data from different populations; this would increase sample sizes and facilitate the study of rare or highly specific subgroups.A common information frameworkEMIF will develop a common information framework that will not only facilitate access to existing data sources, but ease the creation of links between sources and, where needed, collect additional information. The work will require the team to address a number of issues, including data standards, semantic interoperability, ethics, data privacy, legal issues, and the development of an IT platform that allows access to multiple data sources.To guide the development of the framework, the team will initially focus on two key research issues:identifying the mechanisms that make some people more susceptible to dementias (such as Alzheimer’s disease) than others;determining which individuals with obesity are most likely to develop complications such as diabetes.Obesity and dementia are two of the greatest healthcare challenges of our time; EMIF’s work will pave the way for new diagnostic tools and treatments to help patients with these conditions. Looking to the future, additional research areas may be added to the framework through future IMI Calls for proposals.","Amgen, Brussels, Belgium:Boehringer Ingelheim Internationalgmbh, Ingelheim, Germany:F.

Among its main achievements are the establishment of the most comprehensive online postgraduate course catalogue in Europe; a PhD workshop for students to learn more about industry needs; and a pan-European community working together to build a coherent framework for continuing professional development in biomedical science.Education and training are important aspects of biomedical research and development. As the landscape and the technologies are constantly changing, it is important that the training providers also adapt quickly. By bringing together industry and academic partners, EMTRAIN established a pan-European platform for education and training, covering the entire life cycle of medicines, from basic research, clinical tests and market authorisation to follow-up research of drugs already on the market. More specifically, the project strengthened cooperation among industry and academia, enabling faster implementation of new scientific and technological developments into academic teaching, and improving the mobility of professionals across disciplines, sectors and national borders.The most comprehensive on-line catalogue in EuropeOne of the main project achievements is on-course®, a comprehensive online course catalogue which covers everything that is taught in pharmaceutical medicine and sciences across Europe and neighbouring countries. The catalogue lists more than 8 000 different courses, ranging from one-day courses to PhD programmes. Free and easy to use, it allows users to search for courses by type (master, PhD, short course), schedule (full or part-time, modular), learning type (distance, face-to-face, mixed), language, location, and scientific / therapeutic area. For each course, the catalogue provides a description, list of modules (if relevant), details of fees, contact information, and links to the course websites. It is continuously updated by course administrators and can be accessed for free. The portal is intended to become the reference platform for education and training in biomedical sciences, and will help ensure that the biomedical education and training landscape is geared towards keeping Europe at the forefront of research. It already has more than 100 000 users.Creating a generation of industry-aware studentsEMTRAIN also developed a workshop for PhD students to provide young researchers with a holistic understanding of medicines development and an insight into the pharmaceutical industry. This week-long workshop is creating a growing alumni network of industry-aware students, facilitating employment opportunities and strengthening cooperation between industry and academia.Another project achievement is a LifeTrain, a community-based platform for life-long learning which brings together employers, course providers and students. The platform established the principles for mutually-recognised lifelong learning and developed competency profiles, assessment of competencies and recognition processes. The platform also enables students to adapt their training to industry needs, increasing their chances of employment; helps academia tailor their programmes according to real-time industry needs; and helps industry get access to professionals with specific training.For the benefit of industry and academiaBy participating in this project, the academic community learned more about how the industry works, enabling them to adapt their courses according to real-time industry needs. Thanks to this project, young PhD researchers also gained insights into career opportunities in the private sector.Industry partners benefitted by gaining access to industry-aware professionals with specific training tailored to their needs. Furthermore, EMTRAIN’s framework for competency development allows better comparability of job profiles, supporting the mobility of professionals in this field. Last but not least, the on-course® catalogue gives industry easy access to continuous professional development courses which are not covered by companies’ own training activities, saving time and resources.Finally, the project strengthened the pan-European community of scientists in medicines development, benefitting both the industry and academia.What’s nextEven though the project ended, most of its tools and platforms continue to operate.The LifeTrain concept and framework has been taken up by one of the project partners, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg. Its work continues through workshops and conferences.The PhD course has been taken up by the Horizon 2020 project C-COMEND and is being further optimised as part of this project.The on-course® platform continues to operate in the context of other Horizon 2020 projects (e.g. RITrain).Read the interview with project coordinators","Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Bayer Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany:Boehringer Ingelheim Internationalgmbh, Ingelheim, Germany:Esteve Pharmaceuticals, SA, Barcelona, Spain:F.

ENABLE,Fraunhofer,,GSK,completing before August 2020,01/02/2014,31/01/2020,IMI1,8,Group Antibiotic resistance,European Gram-negative Antibacterial Engine,Antimicrobial resistance:Infectious diseases:ND4BB:Drug discovery,RIA (Research and Innovation Action),115583,58 900 000,22 952 360,,18 982 451,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major public health threat. Infections caused by resistant bacteria are increasing and causing Europe to face soaring costs both in terms of lives and public health expenditure. Despite the strong need for new antimicrobials, very few new, effective antibiotics have been brought to the market in the last decades. The ENABLE project, within IMI’s New Drugs for Bad Bugs (ND4BB) programme, is working to advance the development of potential antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop attractive antimicrobial candidates for testing in the clinic, bringing the possibility of new antibiotics to treat Gram-negative infections one step closer to patients.
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global public health threat. Bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to existing antibiotics, with the rising mortality rate and extended hospitalisation for patients translating into soaring treatment and societal costs. In Europe alone, AMR causes 25 000 deaths every year; two thirds of these are due to Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli. The clinical burden associated with AMR is estimated to cost Europe approximately €1.5 billion per year. Increasingly resistant bacteria trigger the continuous need for new, effective antibiotics. Nonetheless, only two new classes of antibiotics have been brought to the market in the last 30 years and many drug developers have left the field. This mainly due to two factors: firstly, the discovery, development and delivery of new and effective antibiotics is hampered by both scientific and regulatory challenges; secondly, antibiotics have a low return on investment compared to other medicines, making it an unattractive area for drug developers.Accelerating the delivery of new antibioticsWhile there is a strong need for new medicines to treat resistant Gram-negative infections, the industrial pipeline of new drugs remains quite limited. The ENABLE project will create and manage a drug discovery platform for testing and optimising molecules that are still in the earlier stages of drug discovery but have the potential to become future drug candidates capable of treating resistant Gram-negative infections. Once up and running, the platform will be able to run several drug discovery programmes in parallel.Researchers in the ENABLE project who have interesting molecules that could benefit from the platform will have the opportunity to collaborate with a diverse range of experts in microbiology, pharmacology and chemistry to help advance their molecule through the drug development process until it is an attractive candidate for clinical testing.The project will focus on the discovery and pre-clinical stages of drug development, as well as (potentially) phase 1 clinical trials, during which a new drug is tested in humans for the first time. Molecule owners wishing to continue with more advanced clinical trials will be able to do so outside the ENABLE project.More specifically, the project is working towards:identifying three antibacterial lead molecules which, following extensive testing, have been identified as having promising antimicrobial activity;identifying two antibacterial clinical candidate molecules. At this stage, the final structure of the molecule is set. The candidate then undergoes more preclinical testing before being studied in humans;progressing at least one compound into preclinical and phase 1 clinical studies, i.e. early clinical safety testing in humans.In a nutshell, the unprecedented scientific collaboration carried out within the ENABLE project will improve early-stage antibacterial drug discovery and advance the progress of new medicines through the scientific pipelines so that they are ready for testing in patients.The new antibiotics programmes run by the ENABLE platform will come from European research institutions and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). There are initially seven programmes in the ENABLE portfolio.  In addition, a programme arising from an alliance between GSK and Sanofi will also make use of the platform.This portfolio of programmes will be expanded through open calls for additional antimicrobial programmes from the academic and SME community, to create the most promising portfolio of drug candidates to treat Gram-negative infections. The project has funding to advance a minimum of eight programmes through early testing, with the ultimate goal of obtaining at least one drug molecule for early testing in humans by 2019.Boosting European scientific competitivenessSpanning 13 countries, ENABLE brings together an initial set of 32 partners including 11 SMEs. The unique scientific collaboration stemming from ENABLE will greatly contribute to making Europe a world leader in antimicrobial drug discovery. The creation of a cooperative environment will respond to Europe’s fight against antibiotic resistance and make a sustainable impact on the future of antibacterial drug discovery. ENABLE is the third project of IMI’s New Drugs 4 Bad Bugs (ND4BB) programme – a series of projects designed to directly address the scientific, regulatory and economic challenges associated with antibacterial drug discovery and development.The need for public-private collaborationAMR is a multi-faceted and complex issue, and no single organisation or country can tackle it alone. A public-private partnership thus provides unique opportunities for collaboration between leading European academic researchers, SMEs and the pharmaceutical industry – working together to discover new drugs to treat Gram-negative infections.It is expected that this joint effort by top experts from different fields will maximise scientific excellence and ensure that the drug discovery programmes selected in ENABLE will progress much more efficiently than if they had been pursued in isolation. SMEs participating in ENABLE will benefit from access to the top antimicrobial drug discovery and development expertise brought in by other partners to see their molecules further developed. ENABLE also puts into practice some principles of collaboration and open innovation through an unprecedented intellectual property (IP) agreement that was tailored to meet the needs of the project. A key aspect of the agreement is that it allows improvements made to a molecule within the project to be assigned to the original molecule owner. At the same time, agreed mechanisms to compensate those partners that contributed to the improvements were found.  The project therefore represents a clear opportunity to enhance in an open and transparent way the collaborative impact of pharmaceutical research, and the IP policy could prove inspirational for R&D collaborations in other disease areas.","Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Basilea Pharmaceutica International AG, Basel, Switzerland:Glaxosmithkline Research And Development LTD., Brentford, Middlesex, United Kingdom:Sanofi-Aventis Recherche & Developpement, Chilly Mazarin, France","Agencia Estatal Consejo Superior De Investigaciones Cientificas, Madrid, Spain:Asclepia Outsourcing Solutions BVBA, Destelbergen, Belgium:Aston University, Birmingham, United Kingdom:Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom:Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, Paris, France:European Biotechnology Network aisbl, Brussels, Belgium:Forschungszentrum Borstel, Borstel, Germany:Fundación Centro de Excelencia en Investigación de Medicamentos Innovadores en Andalucia MEDINA, Granada, Spain:Helmholtz-Zentrum Fuer Infektionsforschung GMBH, Braunschweig, Germany:John Innes Centre, Norwich, United Kingdom:Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden:Kobenhavns Universitet, Copenhagen, Denmark:Latvijas Organiskas Sintezes Instituts, Riga, Latvia:National Medicines Institute (Narodowy Instytut Lekow), Warsaw , Poland:Region Hovedstaden, Hilleroed, Denmark:Research Institutes of Sweden AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Servicio Madrileno De Salud, Madrid, Spain:St George’s Hospital Medical School (trading as St George's University of London), London, United Kingdom:Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen S, Denmark:Stichting Vu, Amsterdam, Netherlands:The University Court of the University of St Andrews, St Andrews, Fife, United Kingdom:Universitat Zurich, Zürich, Switzerland:University of Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland:University of Liège, Liège, Belgium:University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom:Universität de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain:Uppsala Universitet, Uppsala, Sweden","Beactica AB, Uppsala, Sweden:Bioresources Technology & Engineering GmbH, Giessen, Germany:Helperby Therapeutics Ltd, London, United Kingdom:Inspiralis Ltd, Norwich, United Kingdom:Juvabis AG, Furigen, Switzerland:Molecular Discovery LTD, London, United Kingdom:Mutabilis, Paris, France:Northern Antibiotics Oy, Helsinki, Finland:Nosopharm SAS, Nimes, France:Recipharm OT Chemistry, Uppsala, Sweden:Redx Pharma Ltd, Liverpool, United Kingdom:Spero Europe Limited, Godalming, Surrey, United Kingdom:The Research Network Ltd., Sandwch, United Kingdom","Redx Anti-Infectives Ltd, Manchester, United Kingdom:Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen S, Denmark",,Agencia Estatal Consejo Superior De Investigaciones Cientificas:54 953:Asclepia Outsourcing Solutions BVBA:480 802:Aston University:240 646:Beactica AB:169 699:Bioresources Technology & Engineering GmbH:86 580:Cardiff University:1 275 588:Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs:364 224:European Biotechnology Network aisbl:285 240:Forschungszentrum Borstel:567 678:Fundación Centro de Excelencia en Investigación de Medicamentos Innovadores en Andalucia MEDINA:215 775:Helmholtz-Zentrum Fuer Infektionsforschung GMBH:448 562:Helperby Therapeutics Ltd:104 120:Inspiralis Ltd:207 168:John Innes Centre:351 120:Juvabis AG:1 499 400:Karolinska Institutet:354 441:KeytoLead AB (left the project):3 721:Kobenhavns Universitet:1 710 018:Latvijas Organiskas Sintezes Instituts:6 065 220:Molecular Discovery LTD:455 910:Mutabilis:2 739 003:National Medicines Institute (Narodowy Instytut Lekow):288 000:Northern Antibiotics Oy:115 994:Nosopharm SAS:1 850 092:Recipharm OT Chemistry:2 314 926:Redx Pharma Ltd:36 450:Region Hovedstaden:476 100:Research Institutes of Sweden AB:3 395 700:Servicio Madrileno De Salud:586 800:Spero Europe Limited:41 460:St George’s Hospital Medical School (trading as St George's University of London):92 200:Statens Serum Institut:962 561:Stichting Vu:1 636 530:The Research Network Ltd.:277 085:The University Court of the University of St Andrews:29 588:Universitat Zurich:777 650:University of Helsinki:1 030 230:University of Liège:27 580:University of Oxford:1 440 722:Universität de Barcelona:44 340:Uppsala Universitet:24 712 997:Redx Anti-Infectives Ltd:547 274:Statens Serum Institut:535 853:Total Cost:58 900 000,http://nd4bb-enable.eu,?,"IMI: Angela Wittelsberger

EPAD,,,Janssen,completing before August 2020,01/01/2015,31/12/2019,IMI1,11,Group Neurodegenerative diseases,European prevention of Alzheimer’s dementia consortium,Neurodegenerative diseases:Alzheimer's disease:Clinical trial design:Conducting clinical trials,RIA (Research and Innovation Action),115736,25 880 000,27 488 286,,6 534 750,"There is an urgent need for new treatments for Alzheimer’s disease. The number of people affected worldwide is expected to reach over 100 million by 2050, yet despite intensive efforts over many years, there is still no cure for Alzheimer’s and little in the way of treatments. Today, research increasingly focuses on ways to prevent the onset of Alzheimer’s in the first place. The EPAD project is pioneering a novel, more flexible approach to clinical trials of drugs designed to prevent Alzheimer’s dementia. Using an ‘adaptive’ trial design should deliver better results faster and at lower cost.
Dementia – focus on preventionDementia primarily affects older people, and symptoms include memory loss, confusion, difficulties with communication and everyday tasks, and personality changes. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 36 million people globally have dementia, and by 2050 this figure is set to rise to 115 million. A progressive disease that currently has no cure, Alzheimer’s places a huge burden on families, carers and health systems. The total annual costs of Alzheimer’s disease are estimated at around €515 billion, similar to the annual gross domestic product (GDP) of Belgium.Considerable effort has gone into the search for a cure for Alzheimer’s. However, it is now well known that signs of Alzheimer’s disease can be found in the brain decades before the first symptoms appear. Researchers are therefore increasingly focusing their efforts on finding ways of stopping the disease in its tracks during this pre-symptomatic phase to prevent the disease entirely or at least delay the onset of symptoms.Challenges here include the difficulty of identifying people who are likely to develop Alzheimer’s dementia, our poor understanding of these earliest stages of the disease, and a lack of flexibility in the way clinical trials are carried out.The EPAD project is addressing these problems in a number of ways. Firstly, it will draw on existing national and regional registers of people at risk of developing Alzheimer’s dementia to create a single, pan-European EPAD register of around 24 000 people. Of these, the 6 000 deemed to be at greatest risk of Alzheimer’s dementia will be invited to join an EPAD cohort of at risk subjects. This group will undergo standardised tests and follow-up. Finally, the project will select around 1 500 people from this EPAD cohort to take part in early stage ‘adaptive’ clinical trials of drugs designed to prevent Alzheimer’s dementia.Trialling adaptive trials for Alzheimer’s preventionIn traditional clinical trials, half of the people participating in the trial receive the drug under investigation, and half receive a placebo. Trials may last years and cost a lot of money. In adaptive clinical trials, several candidate drugs are simultaneously compared to each other and to a placebo, meaning that a greater proportion of patients benefit from a potentially active treatment. Furthermore, in an adaptive trial, researchers can adapt the trial design in response to emerging results. For example, if a candidate medicine appears to be particularly effective in only certain groups of people, that medicine can be preferentially given to those people in order to confirm the finding. Similarly, new candidate drugs can be added to the trial and medicines that prove ineffective can be dropped. In addition, adaptive trials allow researchers to test both individual drugs and combinations of different medicines.This innovative trial design has already proven effective for testing new treatments for breast cancer. The EPAD project is pioneering this approach in Alzheimer’s disease. By adopting this approach, the project expects to be able to identify ineffective medicines earlier in drug development and so avoid failures in more advanced (Phase III) trials. By setting up a cohort of patients ready to enter trials and creating a pan-European network of trial sites, EPAD will also make clinical trials more efficient.Patients are well represented in the project; this will ensure the project responds to the needs of people with dementia and their families.The EPAD project does not operate alone. Together with IMI’s EMIF-AD and AETIONOMY projects, it forms the IMI Alzheimer’s disease platform. It is also working closely with other, similar initiatives worldwide, including the US-based Global Alzheimer’s Platform.In addition, all data collected from the EPAD cohort and trial will be made publicly available for analysis to help researchers everywhere improve their understanding of the early, pre-dementia phase of Alzheimer’s disease.Ultimately, the hope is that this project will reinvigorate the development of treatments for one of the most challenging diseases facing our ageing societies.","Ac Immune SA, Lausanne, Switzerland:Amgen, Brussels, Belgium:Biogen Idec Limited, Maidenhead, Berkshire, United Kingdom:Boehringer Ingelheim Internationalgmbh, Ingelheim, Germany:Eisai Inc, Woodcliff Lake, United States :Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Basingstoke, United Kingdom:F.

In medical research, consequences include poor decision-making resulting in higher failure rates and longer drug development times. There is therefore an urgent need for simple, sustainable solutions to improve data quality, and that’s where the EQIPD project comes in. Their goal is to deliver simple recommendations to facilitate data quality without impacting innovation.The project team will start by analysing the variables in study design and data analysis that influence outcomes and establishing whether these are the same in academia and industry. They will then define the components of an EQIPD quality management system and work to achieve a consensus among different stakeholders on quality management recommendations for research. They will also assess the feasibility of the quality management system in prospective studies in the fields of neuroscience and safety.Finally, the project will set up an online educational platform that will deliver certified courses in the principles and application of data quality and rigour.

The eTOX project broke ground in that it enabled pharmaceutical companies to share their data on the toxicity of drug-like compounds for the first time on a large scale. This resulted in the creation of a large database, which can now be mined for further insights, including predictions on whether or not a particular compound is likely to have an adverse effect on patients. This is already helping pharmaceutical companies to make better-informed decisions in their pursuit of developing safer drugs, while at the same time reducing the use of animals in drug research.Studies designed to predict adverse side effects in the initial phases of drug development are very important as they lower the failure rate in later phases, ensuring that companies invest resources in only the most promising drugs, and that only safe drugs reach patients. In order to improve drug safety, the pharmaceutical industry has produced vast amounts of preclinical toxicology data needed to develop compounds into drugs. After fulfilling its initial purpose, this data used to rest in individual companies’ archives, despite the fact that a lot of further knowledge could be extracted from it. However, companies used to consider this data as part of their competitive space, and so kept it to themselves.By bringing together top experts in toxicology, knowledge management, bioinformatics, chemo-informatics, biostatistics and software development, the eTOX project set out to bring together this treasure trove of toxicological information into one database, so that it could be shared among companies for the first time, and probed for further insights. The result is a unique toxicology information database, eTOXsys, which now contains information from over 8 000 toxicity studies on almost 2 000 compounds, of which around a fifth are approved drugs. The studies done on these compounds amount to about 9 million data points about the toxicology of those compounds. This database is now commercially accessible and can be searched and mined, thanks to the tools that have been built by the academic part of the consortium.More than 200 predictive computer-based modelsBuilding on this treasure trove of toxicology data, which has been organised and standardised, the consortium further constructed more than 200 predictive computer-based models that have the ability to give researchers an idea of the potential toxicity of future drug-like compounds. These models make their predictions by using the complex relationships between the structure of a substance, its metabolism and disposition, and its toxic effects in the body. They enable researchers to better predict potential side effects that would otherwise only be discovered in a later stage of the drug development or when the drug is already on the market.These computer models have been annotated in terms of the data and methods used for developing them. The academic partners in the project also developed eTOXlab, a platform for the development and maintenance of these models.Developing a standardised language One of the obstacles to extracting further insights from this wealth of toxicology data was that there was no common terminology between different researchers and companies. In order for all this toxicological data to be useful for further analysis, eTOX had to construct standardised terminology (ontologies). As part of this process, project researchers looked over more than 20 million entry lines, reducing more than 80 000 terms used in the initial data sources to under 7 000 preferred terms. These ontologies are now publicly available through the OntoBrowser tool and will be a valuable asset for future research.Reducing the use of animals in researchThe database and models developed within eTOX have also contributed to reducing the use of animals in research. For example, until now, pharmaceutical companies working on similar targets used to synthesise competitor compounds in order to perform laboratory studies to compare the toxicity of competitors’ compounds with their in-house candidates. Since their competitors’ toxicological data can now be found in the eTOXsys database, they no longer need to do this. According to project coordinators, there are already multiple examples of cases where information provided by eTOXsys prevented companies from running new studies on animals.For the benefit of industry, academia, SMEsThe industry is already benefitting from the tools developed in this project, especially the eTOXsys database. For example, if a company is developing a new compound with a toxicity that is disturbing, their research teams can now go to the database to try to find a similar compound with a similar structure or a similar effect in a similar species. This is already saving time and resources, and allowing drug makers to make better-informed decisions, which could ultimately lead to safer drugs for patients. Thanks to eTOX, the industry also gained access to academic knowledge and skills, which they don’t have internally.The academic partners have in turn benefited from learning to work together with the pharmaceutical companies, and having access to toxicity data from the industry that they otherwise would not have. The project also enabled them to develop new computer models for predicting the toxicity of drugs, as well as tools and technologies for sharing all this data.The SMEs in the project benefitted from working with their main customers in the pharmaceutical industry, and getting to know more about who their customers are, what they want, how they think and what they do. Additionally, SMEs have gained a new business as a result of this project: eTOXsys is now commercially available and two SMEs are in charge of maintaining and managing it.What’s next?eTOX gave rise to a successor IMI project, eTRANSAFE, which will assess the validity of the predictive value of animal data for human safety. This successor project has the potential to modify the way researchers conduct preclinical studies, and could potentially have an even bigger impact than eTOX.Read the interview with project coordinators","Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Bayer Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany:Boehringer Ingelheim Internationalgmbh, Ingelheim, Germany:Esteve Pharmaceuticals, SA, Barcelona, Spain:F.

In addition, the project partners will provide associated support, expertise and services to ensure users gain the maximum benefit from the platform.
Reducing redundancyBy the beginning of 2012, IMI had launched 30 projects, many of which involve the integration and analysis of diverse types of biological and medical data from a range of sources. This approach helps to speed up and improve drug discovery by allowing researchers to uncover new insights into disease progression and drug safety and efficacy for example. However, merging and managing all this data is far from easy. IMI’s first Strategic Research Agenda highlighted the need for a common knowledge management platform for IMI projects, but until now this has not been set up.As a result, each project has had to invest in its own knowledge management system, resulting in considerable duplication of efforts and raising the risk that data will be lost when the project ends. Furthermore, to date there has been no agreed knowledge platform technology that could be used to build such a common service.Enter eTRIKSeTRIKS aims to deliver an open, sustainable translational research informatics / knowledge management platform based on agreed standards. The starting point of the project will be tranSMART, an open source platform that is already being applied successfully in IMI’s severe asthma project U-BIOPRED. The eTRIKS team will provide a suite of support services covering the whole translational research project life cycle, including business analysis, platform development, curation and hosting support, standards development, and ethics consultation.Significant savingsBy creating a single, open source platform that meets industry needs while remaining affordable for public partners, eTRIKS will deliver considerable cost savings for public private partnerships that use it. Furthermore, by ensuring the consistent implementation of format and content standards, eTRIKS will facilitate the reuse of data (with appropriate governance) to study new issues and speed up the development of new drugs for patients.In the longer term, the project plans to develop a business model that will allow the platform to continue to operate after the initial IMI funding period. The partners also hope that their work will result in the formation of an active international translational research analytics and informatics community.","Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, Leverkusen, Germany:Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Basingstoke, United Kingdom:F.

By bringing together academic, regulatory and industry partners, the project developed the first pan-European, internationally-recognised programmes in those fields. Even though the project has officially ended, the platform continues, offering a joint master’s degree, a PhD, 25 joint academic certificates and over 50 short courses. To date, 3 000 training registrations have already been recorded through its modern and easy-to-use e-learning platform.The Eu2P project was set up to respond to the growing need for well-trained professionals, specialists and non-specialists, in pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiology. Pharmacovigilance involves collecting and analysing information from patients and health care providers on potential adverse effect of medications that are already on the market. In pharmacoepidemiology, scientists study, predict and compare the risks and benefits of commercial or experimental medicines in populations.By bringing together 7 academic, 2 regulatory and 15 industry partners, the Eu2P project developed the first pan-European, internationally recognised programmes in pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiology. Through the Eu2P on-line platform, which can be accessed anytime and anywhere, it offers courses which lead to a joint master’s degree, a PhD degree, 25 joint academic certificates and over 50 short courses. Specialisations include topics such benefit assessment of medicines, medicines risk identification and quantification, and medicines risk communication. The programmes target specialists such as pharmacists, physicians, scientists and experienced professionals, but also non specialists such as journalists, lay people, and patients. More than 2 500 course registrations have already been recorded for its short courses and almost 500 people have attended Eu2P’s postgraduate programmes. About 15 % of students so far came from lower income countries (e.g. from Africa and Asia). For them, a limited number of partial grants are available.The emphasis is put on ‘hands-on training’ to maximise post-training employment opportunities. The courses are delivered in English using a unique and innovative modular approach which integrates multimedia lessons, video conferences, online quizzes and assignments.Benefits for academia and industrySix European universities, part of Eu2P, are now offering Eu2P joint certificates and postgraduate programmes in pharmacovigilance and pharmaceopidemology. The establishment of these programmes raised their profile and recognition on an international level. The public partners in the project also benefited from the network and collaborations established during Eu2P.Thanks to the project, industry employees can now get internationally recognised postgraduate certificate diplomas, master’s and PhD degrees, as well as academically recognised short courses which have been tailored to their needs.What’s next?After the project ended in June 2016, six of the universities which were part of the project and five private partners signed a memorandum of understanding to continue the project.

Working to change this is the IMI-funded EU-AIMS project. The goal of EU-AIMS is to generate tools that will enhance our understanding of ASD, and ultimately pave the way for the development of new, safe and effective treatments for use in both children and adults. As well as dramatically improving quality of life, good treatments would help to cut the social and economic costs of ASD.
ASD refers to a diverse group of development disorders that are characterised by difficulties in social interaction and communication, and the presence of unusual repetitive behaviours. It affects one child in 110, with boys at greater risk of developing ASD than girls. ASD is a lifelong condition, and for reasons which are not fully understood, the prevalence of ASD is rising.The precise symptoms and their severity vary widely from one person to another; some are only mildly afflicted and can lead relatively independent lives, while others are severely disabled and require a lot of specialist care. Furthermore, while some individuals are intellectually impaired, others excel in areas like maths and music. Finally, to add to the complication, many people with ASD suffer from other conditions, such as seizures. This diversity of symptoms means that diagnosing ASD is far from easy, and in fact it was only formally recognised as a condition relatively recently.An urgent need for effective treatments
Today, there are no drugs designed specifically to treat ASD; instead, those affected are treated with medicines designed for other conditions. The good news is that recent research has shed new light on the neurobiology behind ASD and identified some genes that increase the risk of autism. The findings suggest that it may actually be possible to treat ASD, something that was once thought to be impossible.EU-AIMS – aiming high
EU-AIMS represents the first time that major pharmaceutical companies are joining forces, along with experts from academia, regulatory authorities and patient groups, to accelerate the development of innovative drugs to treat this complex disorder. In terms of both budget and scope, it is the largest initiative of its kind in the world. EU-AIMS will generate new tools to study the biology behind ASD and test the efficacy of potential treatments. For example, the team will gather samples from people bearing certain mutations associated with ASD; this will pave the way for the generation of cell lines that can be used to test treatments.Elsewhere, the researchers will advance the use of brain scans as a tool to boost ASD drug discovery and also identify which people with ASD might respond best to a given drug. The project will also create a pan-European network of clinical sites. As well as making it easier to run clinical trials, this network will create an interactive platform for those with ASD and professionals. Ultimately, the project aims to come up with methods and tools to develop effective treatments for ASD (in both children and adults) as well as tools to diagnose ASD and assess symptoms in the clinic.Relief for patients
Despite the lack of effective, dedicated ASD treatments, almost three quarters of children with ASD are on medication developed to tackle symptoms like tics, seizures, and hyperactivity. However, there is little evidence to suggest that the benefits outweigh the unpleasant side-effects of these drugs. Furthermore, little is known about what treatments are effective in adults. By paving the way for the development of new treatments, EU-AIMS is set to dramatically improve the quality of life of the growing numbers of people with ASD. In addition, EU-AIMS will help to cut the heavy economic and social costs of autism.Turning Europe into a hotspot for autism research
EU-AIMS brings together Europe’s top ASD researchers from academia, the pharmaceutical industry and patients’ organisations.

EUPATI,,,VFA,Closed,01/02/2012,31/01/2017,IMI1,3,Group Standard,European Patients' Academy on Therapeutic Innovation,Patient involvement in R&D:Education and training,RIA (Research and Innovation Action),115334,5 250 000,5 701 178,,10 951 178,"Medicines research and development (R&D) is an increasingly complex process that is difficult to understand for the majority of patients and the general public. In order to bridge that gap, IMI’s EUPATI project developed a programme on patient engagement in this process. The programme includes an in-depth training course, an online toolbox, national platforms and more, and has been a game-changer for patient empowerment in Europe and beyond. EUPATI graduates are not only better placed to understand and make decisions about their treatments, but are also helping put patients’ needs at the heart of drug development, by joining science, ethical and regulatory committees and getting involved in clinical trial design. While patients are keen to have access to better and safer treatments, many find it hard to understand the benefits and risks of novel therapies. With demand for healthcare rising, and a growing emphasis on both the quality and sustainability of healthcare services, there was a proven need for information resources, designed specifically for patients and the public, on how medicines research and development (R&D) and clinical trials are conducted. By bringing together major patient organisations, academic institutions and industry partners, EUPATI set out to address this major gap in public perception and knowledge.One of the main project outputs is the development of the Patient Expert Training Course – a 14-month in-depth course for patient advocates on medicines R&D. Almost 100 patients from 32 countries and 58 disease areas have already graduated from the course, and more are on the way. In order to multiply the effect of this course, the project has also developed a ‘train-the-trainer programme’.Toolbox and national platformsAnother important project output is the toolbox on medicines R&D which is available in eight languages on the EUPATI website. It includes articles, presentations, videos, webinars, factsheets, and much more. It already has been used by more than 500 000 people worldwide.The project also established 18 national platforms which are based on the same model as EUPATI. By organising educational webinars, information days, workshops, and social media campaigns, the platforms have enabled patients on a national level to become more involved in medicines R&D, and regulatory affairs.Guidance documents and other achievementsOther important project outputs include:guidance documents for the engagement of patient organisations in industry-led R&D, health technology assessment bodies, regulatory processes, and ethics committees;the organisation of interactive annual conferences and workshops which have attracted about 1 200 participants, about 50% of them patient advocates;the organisation of educational webinars on a variety of relevant topics.Patient voices already being heardThrough all these activities, EUPATI has been a catalyst for patient involvement in medicines R&D and continues to be one of the key drivers of the public debate on this topic in Europe and beyond. EUPATI fellows are engaged in regulatory committees, as speakers on medical conferences, and are participating in regulatory and ethics committees. As a result, clinical trials are changing shape, trial outcomes are being defined differently, and patient voices are being heard in regulatory discussions.Patients are also benefitting from a large patient network which was established as part of this project. Patient organisations are usually volunteer-driven, low-resource organisations and before EUPATI they didn’t have the capabilities to work together across different disease areas. Thanks to EUPATI, this has finally changed, and has been a game-changer in patient advocacy.Benefits to academia and industryThe academic community benefited from the project by getting a neutral platform to collaborate with the industry, regulators and patient organisations. Also, a lot of publications co-authored by academics were published in high-impact journals which contributed to increasing their reputation and visibility.The industry benefited from the collaborative network that was established, and from having access to patients who are familiar with all the aspects of R&D and can help in the drug development process with their perspective.What’s next?Even though the project ended, thanks to a three-year sustainability plan, the main project outputs (the course, the toolbox, national platforms) continue to be maintained.  Furthermore, several project partners are continuing to collaborate and initiate new projects.Read the interview with project coordinators","Amgen, Brussels, Belgium:Asociacion Nacional Empresarial De La Industria Farmaceutica, Madrid, Spain:Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Bayer Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany:Boehringer Ingelheim Internationalgmbh, Ingelheim, Germany:Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Corp, Princeton, NJ, United States :Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A, Parma, Italy:Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Basingstoke, United Kingdom:Esteve Pharmaceuticals, SA, Barcelona, Spain:F.

EUROPAIN,,,HLU,Closed,01/10/2009,30/09/2015,IMI1,1,Group Chronic diseases,Understanding chronic pain and improving its treatment,Neurodegenerative diseases:Tools for predicting/monitoring safety:Clinical trial design:Drug discovery,RIA (Research and Innovation Action),115007,6 229 343,11 165 740,,5 155 000,"Only 30% of patients with chronic pain receive effective treatment and when it comes to neuropathic pain, which results from nerve fibres being damaged, dysfunctional or injured, this figure is even lower. By creating unprecedented levels of cooperation among industry, academia and SMEs, Europain transformed the neuropathic pain field in a number of ways. Firstly, it generated the knowledge and tools which will make conducting pre-clinical and clinical trials more reliable and effective. Secondly, it came up with a new way of classifying patients which could lead to the development of more personalised medicines. Thirdly, the project made its mark on European regulatory guidelines and a number of its outputs are already being used by the pharmaceutical industry. In the long-term, patients could reap many benefits by gaining access to more affordable, personalised treatments.
Casting the net wide, producing more than 200 publicationsChronic pain affects one in five Europeans and 7-8% of the whole population has neuropathic pain, a type of pain which results from the nerve fibres themselves being damaged, dysfunctional, or injured. Despite the prevalence and high cost to society, only 30% of people with chronic pain get an effective treatment and in the neuropathic group that figure is even lower. Even though there are a number of different products for treating pain, the last big pain drug concept was invented in 1995. New, more personalised and effective ways of treating pain are sorely needed.By bringing together 12 academic institutions, 11 pharmaceutical companies and an SME, IMI’s Europain project set out to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of pain, and overcome bottlenecks in the development of analgesics (pain killers). The result was a very wide-ranging project which transformed the pain field, resulting it over 200 scientific publications. Its learnings and outputs improved both preclinical and clinical studies, as well as the ability to translate results from animal to patient studies.Pre-clinical studies: happy rats burrow, socialise and venture into lightIn the pre-clinical phase of pain medication studies, one of the main problems is measuring the impact of potential new drugs on laboratory animals, usually rats. In order to improve the situation, Europain scientists set out to provide something that was missing: a standardised and structured way of measuring pain in rats based on their natural behaviour. When healthy and pain-free, rats burrow, socialise and spend more time in the light. When in pain, they burrow and socialise less, and spend more time hiding in the dark. Project scientists measured these behaviours, and validated them across different laboratories in both industry and academia, performing the first multi-centre, double-blind study in a pre-clinical setting. Thanks to this work, four quantitative ways of measuring spontaneous pain behaviour in rats are now available, along with detailed protocols which other scientists can use.From animals to humans: translating results made easierOne of the difficulties in drug discovery is using the results of animal studies to predict what will happen in human patients. In an effort to facilitate this process, Europain scientists were able to show that a technique used to measure pain-related nerve signals, called microneurography, measures the same pain patterns in animals and humans. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) acknowledged that this technique – which involves sticking a fine needle into a nerve to measure pain – can now be used to demonstrate whether a potential drug works. Drug companies are already using the method to help them identify early on which drugs are likely to be effective.Preparing for a clinical study: the power of imaging Clinical studies are lengthy and expensive, and before investing in them, pharmaceutical companies want to know if a potential drug is likely to work in patients. European scientists found that brain imaging could be used to predict early on, in limited groups of patients, whether a potential drug works. They showed that certain areas in the brain are more active when a patient is in pain, and become less active when the patient is given efficacious treatment. They further validated brain imaging as a method which can show whether a potential drug works to reduce pain (proof of mechanism). Some companies are already using this method, which has the potential to save money and ensure that more effective drugs reach patients.Clinical studies: minimising the placebo effectAnother obstacle in clinical studies is the placebo effect, in which a fake treatment (such as a sugar pill) causes a patient’s condition to improve. If large, the placebo effect makes it harder to measure the real effect of a potential drug. In order to understand factors which trigger a placebo response, Europain project scientists studied how different factors in the design of the study affect the placebo response. Out of all the possible factors which could influence the patients, such as the size or the location of the study, they found that the information given to patients at the beginning of the study, likely may be the factor having the greatest impact. For example, patients who knew they were being tested for over-the-counter pain medications had a much lower placebo response than patients who knew they were being tested for morphine-like drugs. This led the scientists to conclude that researchers could be more successful in eliminating the placebo effect if they write the information in the consent forms in a more neutral way, thus lowering patients’ expectations.Other achievements: a new way of grouping patientsDuring its course, Europain tackled a wide range of questions and recorded a number of other achievements. Among the most significant are the following:Creating a database of more than 2 300 neuropathic pain patients and 1 000 healthy volunteers – the largest of its kind in the world. The scientists further classified patients in the database into groups based on their level of sensitivity to pain rather than the type of disease which is at the origin of their pain. The EMA has acknowledged that this is a valid way of classifying patients in early clinical trials and included this new stratification in their guidelines for the development of pain drugs. This represents a paradigm shift in the field of developing treatment for neuropathic pain.Several disease-relevant animal models have been developed and validated across laboratories in industry and academia. They can now be used to study chronic pain due to diabetes, antiretroviral treatment and chemotherapy.A new human model for chemotherapy-induced pain has been developed and validated. Scientists also discovered that sleep deprivation is a valid model for increased sensitivity to pain in both rodents and humans.A discovery that people prone to catastrophising (believing that something is far worse than it actually is) have a higher risk of developing chronic pain in the aftermath of surgery. The project also found that patients who undergo endoscopic (keyhole) surgery develop chronic pain after surgery to a lesser extent than patients who undergo open surgery. This is already helping doctors personalise post-surgery follow-up treatments in some countries.For the benefit of industry, academia and patientsEuropain created unprecedented levels of cooperation in the chronic pain field, and enabled the exchange of knowledge which benefitted both industry and academia. The industry gained new tools which could make pre-clinical and clinical trials cheaper, more reliable and efficient, speeding up the development of innovative medicines. Thanks to the partnership with the industry, the academic community was able to achieve much more than it could have done on its own, raising the profile of European research in this area. Last but not least, patients will reap significant benefits: for example, the new stratification of patients according to their level of sensitivity during clinical trials could lead to the development of more personalised treatments.What happens next?Europain project learnings and outputs have transformed the neuropathic pain field and triggered a lot of new research activity. A number of new projects are now building on the Europain results, and some of them involve one or several partners from the Europain team.Read the interview with the project coordinator","Abbvie Deutschland GMBH & Co Kg, Wiesbaden, Germany:Astellas Pharma Europe BV, Leiden, Netherlands:Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Boehringer Ingelheim Internationalgmbh, Ingelheim, Germany:Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Basingstoke, United Kingdom:Esteve Pharmaceuticals, SA, Barcelona, Spain:Gruenenthal GMBH, Aachen, Germany:H.

The project will add a step to concentrate the virus and refine and test the system before evaluating it in the field.A part of the Ebola+ ProgrammeThe IMI Ebola+ programme was launched in response to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak that started in western Africa in 2014. The comprehensive programme contributes to efforts to tackle a wide range of challenges in Ebola research, including vaccines development, clinical trials, and transport, as well as diagnostics. The programme complements work being carried out with the support of other funding bodies. In addition to Ebola, the programme will also address related diseases, such as Marburg.About Ebolaand related diseasesEbola virus disease (EVD), previously known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is a rare and deadly disease caused by infection with one of the Ebola virus strains. The virus spreads in the human population through direct human-to-human contact with the bodily fluids of infected patients who are showing symptoms. It has an incubation period of 2-21 days, and it usually begins with flu-like symptoms, but rapidly progresses to multiple organ failure and blood-clotting abnormalities which manifest as internal and external haemorrhages (bleeding). It is fatal in between 25% and 90% of cases. There is currently no licensed treatment against EVD, and the development of treatments and preventive measures such as vaccines is hampered by challenges including manufacturing-related hurdles, the stability of vaccines during transport and storage, vaccine deployment, and the time taken to diagnose cases of EVD.Ebola is a member of the filovirus family of viruses, which also includes Marburg virus. Like Ebola, Marburg causes cause severe, often fatal haemorrhagic fever in humans and other primates (monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees), and like Ebola, it is transmitted directly from one person to another. (In contrast, other viruses that cause haemorrhagic fevers are spread via intermediate hosts - for example, dengue fever is transmitted by mosquitoes.) There is no specific treatment or vaccine against Marburg haemorrhagic fever.The 2014-15 Ebola epidemic was unprecedented in its scale and geographical distribution. By the middle of 2015, World Health Organization (WHO) statistics recorded over 27 000 cases and 11 000 deaths from the disease, most of them in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The epidemic highlighted the need for research into better vaccines, diagnostics and treatments to stop future epidemics in their tracks.",,,,,,,http://www.filodiag.eu,Yes,"IMI: Colm Carroll

FLUCOP,,,Sanofi,completing before August 2020,01/03/2015,29/02/2020,IMI1,10,Group Standard,Standardization and development of assays for assessment of influenza vaccines correlates of protection,Respiratory diseases:Infectious diseases:Vaccines,RIA (Research and Innovation Action),115672,6 100 000,6 100 208,,1 648 957,"Every year, pharmaceutical companies develop vaccines designed specifically to combat the strains of flu that are most likely to be in circulation the following winter. Vaccines are also developed in response to emerging pandemics. However, accurately predicting how much protection a new vaccine would actually offer against emerging virus types is far from easy. The FLUCOP project’s goal is to deliver a standardised toolbox to evaluate the ability of new vaccines to stimulate the immune system and compare results from different laboratories, so as to pave the way for future research into which tests will be predictive of vaccine efficacy. Ultimately, the toolbox will improve vaccines research and development globally.
Flu epidemics are common in the winter, and while most people infected will recover without medical intervention, certain groups are at greater risk of suffering complications that may result in hospitalisation and even death. At-risk groups include the elderly, the very young, pregnant women, and people with other underlying health problems such as lung or heart problems or a weakened immune system.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), these seasonal epidemics cause 3-5 million cases of severe illness and up to 500 000 deaths worldwide. Furthermore, flu epidemics place immense strain on health systems, and can affect economic productivity due to sick leave.Vaccines – key to flu preventionThe influenza virus is spread easily and can be transmitted through coughing and by contaminating surfaces. Basic infection control measures (coughing into a tissue, regular handwashing) are important in slowing the spread of the disease. However, the WHO recommends vaccination as the most effective way to prevent the disease, especially in vulnerable people and those who care for them.Today’s flu vaccines do not provide protection against all strains of the virus because of  the ability of the influenza virus to change continuously as it circulates amongst human and animal populations. Therefore, every year the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System closely monitors the strains in circulation and provides advice on the emerging strains likely to be in circulation the following winter. Subsequently, in a race against time, pharmaceutical companies develop, in a matter of months, vaccines designed specifically to protect individuals from infection by those emerging strains.The challenge of checking vaccines A major challenge in flu vaccine development is the need for standardised tests, ideally blood-tests, that rapidly and reliably indicate the level of actual protection that might be expected from a new vaccine against a given emerging strain of the virus. Public research institutions, vaccine manufacturers and other stakeholders currently use tests to measure the immune response that the vaccine generates to the virus in people. However, those tests, which have been locally developed, can vary widely from laboratory to laboratory. This prevents potentially useful comparisons, and limits their value as predictive tools – something that all stakeholders would like to increase.A toolbox for the entire flu vaccine communityFLUCOP represents an unprecedented collaboration between European vaccine manufacturers, academic institutions, regulatory bodies, and public health agencies to improve the toolbox available to evaluate the ability of new influenza vaccines to stimulate the immune system in humans.The collaboration  seeks to improve current tests, develop new tests and, very importantly, to harmonise how those test are performed in different laboratories.In the short term, the toolbox will ensure that results of clinical studies of flu vaccines will be comparable, even if they are carried out at different times and in different laboratories in different parts of the world. In the longer term, it will likely have an impact on the way medicines regulators approve new flu vaccines, and will improve best practice in the way flu vaccines are developed worldwide.","Abbott Biologicals BV, Weesp, Netherlands:Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium:Janssen Vaccines & Prevention BV, Leiden, Netherlands:Sanofi Pasteur SA, Lyon, France:Seqirus S.r.l., Siena, Italy","Bundesinstitut Fur Impfstoffe Und Biomedizinische Arzneimittel, Langen, Germany:Department of Health, Leeds, United Kingdom:Erasmus Universitair Medisch Centrum Rotterdam, Rotterdam, Netherlands:European Vaccine Initiative - EEIG, Heidelberg, Germany:Istituto Superiore Di Sanita, Roma, Italy:Sclavo Vaccines Association, Siena, Italy:Stichting Biomedical Primate Research Center, Rijswijk, Netherlands:The European Medicines Agency, Canary Wharf, London, United Kingdom:Universita' Degli Studi Di Siena, Siena, Italy:Universiteit Gent, Gent, Belgium:Universitetet I Bergen, P.O.

GETREAL,,,GSK,Closed,01/10/2013,31/03/2017,IMI1,7,Group Standard,Incorporating real-life clinical data into drug development,"Clinical trial design:Real-world data, evidence:Regulatory and HTA processes",RIA (Research and Innovation Action),115546,8 000 000,6 910 397,,2 041 883,"Incorporating data from real-life clinical settings into drug development represents a serious challenge for pharmaceutical companies, regulators, and health authorities alike. By bringing together all key stakeholder groups (namely industry, academia, regulatory agencies, reimbursement agencies, healthcare budget holders, and patient groups) to share their insights and know-how, GETREAL developed new tools and resources for incorporating real-life data into drug development. These could increase confidence in new medicines and help to get them to patients more quickly.  Once a new drug has been developed, it must be reviewed by both the regulators (for the decision on marketing authorisation) and health technology assessment (HTA) bodies (for the decision on access to patients). The regulators draw on data, mostly from clinical trials, to determine if a drug is safe and works well enough to be authorised for use in patients. For their part, HTA organisations assess more broadly the value of a new drug for a given healthcare system. For this, they need real-world evidence (RWE) to support the assessment of ‘relative effectiveness’: that is the extent to which a treatment does more good than harm when compared to one or more alternative treatments when provided under normal healthcare circumstances.However, while there are clear, detailed guidelines on how to carry out clinical trials and what is required to achieve marketing authorisation, there is little guidance on how to generate RWE and integrate this into drug development. This is a serious issue: even if a drug is approved as safe and effective by the regulators, insufficient evidence supporting relative effectiveness may delay, or restrict (partially or entirely) patient access to new treatments. The challenge, therefore, is to incorporate relative effectiveness research into the earlier stages of drug research and development. IMI’s GETREAL project set out to bridge that gap.The project broke ground in that it brought together companies, healthcare decision-makers, patient representatives and other stakeholders to begin to work towards building a consensus on best practices in the use of RWE in drug development, as well as regulatory and reimbursement decision-making. The project developed tools, recommendations and guidance for incorporating RWE earlier in the drug development process.Getting to grips with RWE: the Navigator toolOne of the main project achievements was the launch of RWE Navigator. This online resource helps users from a broad range of research and healthcare backgrounds get to grips with the need for and the generation of RWE, and understand how this can be used to inform decision-making.The RWE Navigator is designed to help users from industry define and implement a robust RWE generation plan; HTAs and regulators to better understand the analytical models used; and patients to understand concepts related to RWE and the challenges faced when using or generating RWE. It directs users to the TOOLBOX, which in turn guides them on how to define the attributes of the medicine that may drive a difference in the efficacy seen in a clinical trial setting, compared to the effectiveness when used in routine healthcare (often referred to as the efficacy-effectiveness gap). It also informs users on the specific types of analyses or study designs that can be used to generate or model RWE, including their pros and cons, and includes a comprehensive directory of resources to support users in implementing their RWE generation plans.Pragmatic trials and the PRAGMAGIC toolPragmatic trials offer an opportunity to generate high-quality evidence on relative effectiveness prior to and (soon) after drug launch. However, many people are still reluctant to conduct such studies as they are very challenging to implement and there is some uncertainty regarding the acceptability of pragmatic trial data in decision-making.In order to aid researchers in pragmatic clinical trial design, the GETREAL project developed an innovative online tool called PRAGMAGIC. It is a decision support tool designed to help users understand how the choices that they make when designing a pragmatic trial can impact the operational feasibility of the study, and how reflective the data generated will be of the effectiveness of the medicine in routine healthcare. The tool draws on guidance and recommendations accumulated through methods reviews, case studies and stakeholder feedback. The project hopes that the new tool will increase the understanding of the value and feasibility of conducting pragmatic trials in the future.Demystifying relative effectiveness assessmentsBoth network meta-analysis (NMA) and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) are useful methods for assessing the relative effectiveness of medicines by using data generated from randomised controlled trials. These methods are gaining acceptance among industry, academia, HTA agencies, and regulatory bodies. However, continued efforts are required to embed these approaches in decision-making. To this end, GETREAL  developed the ADDIS tool, which provides users access to clinical trial data and the software required to apply NMA and MCDA to the data. Additionally, GETREAL improved the NMA and MCDA methods further by developing a methodology to include real-world data.Webinars, courses and other achievementsOther important project achievements include:An interactive online course entitled ‘Real-world evidence in medicine development’. Under the supervision of leading academics from the project, the course provides students with an understanding of current techniques, opportunities and challenges for the use of real-world evidence in medicine development.RWE policy recommendations written by the project’s Policy Expert Group, setting out seven key themes that require further attention to advance the use of RWE and RWD in drug development.A network of regulators, HTA organisations, companies, academics, healthcare professionals, patients and other societal stakeholders. This network is important because the challenges faced by the pharmaceutical industry, regulators and other healthcare decision makers are all interlinked.GETREAL also hosted a series of webinars to support the dissemination of information and organised many cross-sector workshops and events attracting participants from academia, industry, regulatory bodies and patient organisations from across Europe.For the benefit of industry, academia and SMEsAll of the partners in the project benefitted from the network which was created and collaboration with different stakeholders. This was a unique opportunity for the different stakeholders to share experiences and perspectives in RWE generation and use in decision-making, and all of them will benefit from a greater consensus on the issue.As the funding for methodology development can be scarce, the academic partners also benefited from IMI funding, which enabled them to drive the development of innovative RWE analytical approaches, published in high-impact journals.Last but not least, the SME in the project was able to demonstrate their leadership in this field, and had the opportunity to work with leading academics and major pharmaceutical companies who ultimately are their key customers. Through publications and meeting attendance, they were also able to increase their company’s visibility.What’s next?GETREAL project partners applied for additional funding through IMI2 - Call 11 for the exploitation of project results. The follow-up project will start in June 2018 and will build on the success of GETREAL. In particular, the follow-up project will be used to continue building the research community, drive forward some of the project’s policy recommendations, and take forward the global debate regarding the opportunities for and the barriers to the use of RWE in healthcare decision-making.Read the interview with the project coordinator.","Amgen, Brussels, Belgium:Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Bayer Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany:Boehringer Ingelheim Internationalgmbh, Ingelheim, Germany:Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Corp, Princeton, NJ, United States :Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Basingstoke, United Kingdom:F.

Thanks to inhaled antibiotics, patients now live longer than ever before and enjoy a better quality of life. However, infections are increasingly becoming resistant to the few drugs available, putting patients’ lives at risk. The iABC project is advancing the development of two inhaled antibiotics for patients with CF and BE. It is also working to identify ways of improving clinical trials of treatments for these serious diseases.
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a serious and growing threat to human and animal health worldwide. In the EU alone, AMR is responsible for some 25 000 deaths every year, and the annual treatment and social costs have been estimated at €1.5 billion. Meanwhile, new forms of resistance continue to develop and spread, leaving clinicians with few weapons to bring infections under control. Yet despite the recognised need for new antibiotics, the reality is that only two new classes of antibiotics have been brought to the market in the last three decades.A vulnerable groupPatients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and bronchiectasis (BE) are at particular risk of infection. CF is a common inherited disease that affects around 36 000 people in the EU. CF patients face regular respiratory infections; 60% of adult patients have lung infections caused by difficult to treat bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and respiratory failure is the cause of death for 95% of CF patients. Inhaled antibiotics have helped to both improve CF patients’ quality of life and extend their life expectancy.BE refers to a group of diseases in which the airways become damaged and scarred. It is more common among the elderly, affecting 3 in 1 000 among the over 75s. BE patients experience similar symptoms to CF, including regular respiratory infections, often with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. So far, no inhaled antibiotics have been approved for use in BE patients, although in practice doctors often treat BE patients with antibiotics licensed for use in CF.Today, the number of inhaled antibiotics available for these vulnerable patients remain limited and infections in both CF and BE patients are increasingly resistant to these life-saving medicines. The costs of carrying out clinical trials for new antibiotics for CF and BE patients are particularly high due to the relatively small number of patients affected.Towards new treatments for cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasisiABC will advance the development of two inhaled antimicrobials. BAL30072 is a novel antibiotic that is effective against a range of bacterial infections. The project will develop a version of the antibiotic that can be inhaled by patients with CF and BE. Studies will probe the safety of the inhaled antibiotic and determine the ideal dose. The project will also investigate the appropriate dose of tobramycin inhalation powder (TIP) in treatment of lung infections in BE patients and how safe and effective this dose is in these patients. TIP is currently only licensed for use in CF patients.More broadly, the programme will undertake a number of activities designed to facilitate future research into and clinical trials involving CF and BE.  For example, part of the project is devoted to setting up an EU-wide registry of BE patients that would align new and existing national registries and facilitate the gathering of data on BE in Europe. This will aid in the identification of research needs, make it easier to identify patients who could be included in clinical trials, and guide the development of European guidelines for the management of BE.  iABC will ensure that the BE registry will remain viable after the end of the project.Another project goal is to identify measures that could be used in clinical trials to assess the effectiveness of a medicine. These will include new ways of more accurately assessing lung function, DNA fingerprinting of bacteria, measurement of inflammatory biomarkers in the sputum and scoring CT (computed tomography) scans of the chest. The project will also study the nature and level of microbes found in the sputum.New hope for patientsJust a few decades ago, most CF patients died in early childhood. Thanks to antibiotics, CF patients born today can expect to reach early middle age. However, this progress is threatened by the rise of antimicrobial resistance. The iABC project represents an important contribution to efforts to counter this threat.",,,,,,,http://www.iabcproject.com,Yes,"IMI: Angela Wittelsberger

However, we still know little about what happens to medicines after release into the environment and what effect they have on wildlife. Although measures are in place to limit the environmental impact of new medicines, more research is needed in this important area. The iPiE project’s goal is to develop a framework that will provide methodologies to prioritise new and existing medicinal compounds for a comprehensive environmental risk assessment. As such it will support and inform regulatory activities designed to assess and reduce the environmental impact of medicines.
The active ingredients in medicines (known as the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API) can be released into the environment in a variety of ways. The most common route is via the sewage system, when patients excrete them. APIs can also escape into the environment when people dispose of medicines incorrectly, and during the manufacturing process. APIs are, by definition, biologically active, and although their concentration in the environment is generally extremely low, there are concerns about the effect of these chemicals on wildlife and ecosystems in general.Since 2006, new medicines have had to undergo an environmental risk assessment before they are approved for use. However, current testing strategies need to be optimised to accurately predict harmful impacts on wildlife.Furthermore, there are over 3 000 APIs that were already in use before the new rules came into force, and just a small number of these have been subjected to environmental impact testing. As testing all of these will be a mammoth task, guidance is needed to help identify which of these ‘legacy’ APIs are most likely to pose a risk to the environment and so should be prioritised for testing.New, better methodologies for assessing environmental risksThe goal of the iPiE project is to develop frameworks to support the environmental testing of new pharmaceuticals and to help prioritise testing of legacy APIs. The frameworks will draw on information such as existing data on the environmental impact of APIs, toxicological studies, computer models, and studies of how medicines work.Part of the project focuses on identifying existing methods for carrying out pharmaceutical environmental risk assessments. The project is also compiling a database that will include information on both APIs and test organisms. Another priority for the project is the development of new models for estimating exposure to APIs; this will take account of questions such as how much of an ingredient gets into the environment, how fast it is broken down, and the extent to which is accumulates in different parts of the environment. These methods will feed into the development of an exposure assessment tool that can be used to screen APIs under development and prioritise which existing APIs should undergo enhanced testing. In addition, the project plans to develop methods to predict the effects of APIs on different organisms in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. All models developed by the project will be validated experimentally.User-friendly software and guidanceAn important component of the project involves integrating the databases and methods developed into a user-friendly iPiE software system. Researchers will be able to carry out both simple searches and more advanced analyses based on scientific hypotheses. Accompanying guidance will demonstrate how the software can be used to both screen new APIs and prioritise testing of existing APIs.Building on the work of other IMI projectsThe iPiE project will draw heavily on the work of two existing IMI projects: eTOX and Open PHACTS. The iPiE database will be modelled on the eTOX database, which contains detailed information on the toxicity to humans of many existing APIs and so includes some fields required for the iPiE database. Another part of the iPiE project entails delving into publicly-available information, and for this iPiE will use the expertise of Open PHACTS, which specialises in this area.A lasting impactThe iPiE project will make it easier for researchers to evaluate the potential impacts of new medicines in the earlier stages of development. It will also facilitate the identification of medicines that have never undergone environmental assessment yet could pose a serious risk to wildlife and the environment. Ultimately, by ensuring that APIs are developed and used in an environmentally sustainable way, the project will contribute to the health of the natural environment.","Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, Leverkusen, Germany:Boehringer Ingelheim Internationalgmbh, Ingelheim, Germany:Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Corp, Princeton, NJ, United States :Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Basingstoke, United Kingdom:F.

IMI’s K4DD project improved our understanding of how potential drugs bind with their target, and developed methods and tools to allow researchers to study drug-target interactions with greater ease. These tools will help scientists to determine whether a drug candidate is likely to be safe and effective much earlier in the drug development process.
A major difficulty for those attempting to develop new medicines is predicting whether or not a potential drug will be effective. Currently, researchers spend a lot of time studying how strongly a potential drug binds with its target. However, less attention is given to the question of how long the drug remains bound to the target.Nevertheless, there is mounting evidence to suggest that the kinetics of the interaction between a drug and its target have a strong influence on the clinical success of a drug. For example, studies have shown that many recently marketed drugs have improved kinetic profiles. This is logical; as drugs only work when they are bound to the target, the lifetime of the drug-target complex is key to the success of a drug.By bringing together a diverse group of experts from industry, academia and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), K4DD set out to give a major boost to this important area of drug development. One of the main project achievements is a better understanding of binding kinetics, and exactly how small molecules interact with their targets. The project also helped raise awareness of the importance of considering the kinetic aspects of drug-target interactions throughout drug development.Development of tests systems and new technologiesIn order to implement target binding kinetics in the drug discovery process, researchers first had to develop test systems (assays) that specifically measure the kinetic properties of a compound. K4DD developed several assays, which have now been published and can be used on a routine basis by everyone in the scientific community. Furthermore, K4DD project scientists have already been using these systems to deepen their understanding of compound properties that trigger certain behaviour, therefore laying the foundation for a broader use.SMEs outside of the project have further built on these ideas by developing and commercialising several off-the-shelf kits for analysing drug-protein binding kinetics. An SME within the consortium, Sierra Sensors, also developed a molecular affinity screening machine that can be used for measuring drug-protein binding kinetics data in a high-throughput format.A database, a toolbox and other achievementsOther important project achievements include:a comprehensive database of kinetic data which is now publicly available through ChEMBL;a toolbox of computational methods for studying molecular binding kinetics, and the computational tools that employ them;an improved understanding of how drug molecules bind with specific receptors that are important therapeutic targets for diseases such as Parkinson’s and cancer.The project also resulted in the creation of a spin off. Called Phenaris, it will develop ToxPHACTS, a software that will combine K4DD and eTOX project outputs with the Open PHACTS discovery platform.For the benefit of industry, academia and SMEsThe academic partners within the project benefited from getting to know how things work in industry. They also got access to industry resources such as compounds, cells and reagents, which facilitated their work in the field and enabled them to publish papers with more information and impact than they could have generated otherwise. The project also resulted in multiple PhD defences and some of the research fellows later found jobs in industry.The industry benefitted from project outputs, such as assays for testing kinetics. Thanks to the K4DD project, most pharmaceutical companies, and all of the ones which were in the project, started considering the impact of binding kinetics in early drug discovery.The SMEs within the project benefitted from the network that has been established. They developed promising new technologies and one SME, Sierra Sensors, has even been acquired by a larger company, a manufacturer of scientific instruments.Next stepsOne of the most important project legacies is raising the awareness of target binding kinetics. Now that the project is over, this awareness raising will continue through papers that have been published and through about 30 research fellows who were trained within the project and will continue to be the ambassadors of target binding kinetics.The project will also continue to have impact through assays and technologies developed within the project and through the K4DD database, which will be an invaluable asset for future research.Read the interview with the project coordinators","Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, Leverkusen, Germany:F.

In most people, NAFLD does not cause health problems. However, a small proportion (less than 10 %) of people with NAFLD will go on to develop a more serious condition called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The livers of people with NASH are characterised by inflammation and scarring, and they are at a greater risk of developing cirrhosis and liver cancer. The challenge for doctors is identifying which NAFLD patients will go on to develop NASH and, for those with NASH, predicting how fast the disease will progress. Currently, diagnosis requires a liver biopsy, an invasive, often painful procedure that requires a hospital stay. As a result, many patients are not diagnosed until their disease is relatively advanced. The lack of a simple diagnostic tool also hampers the development of new treatments for NAFLD and NASH.The goal of the LITMUS project is therefore to develop and validate highly accurate blood tests and imaging techniques that will allow doctors and researchers to rapidly and easily diagnose the severity of patients’ disease and monitor changes in patients’ livers. The tests should also make it possible to predict which NAFLD patients are at greatest risk of developing NASH, and how fast their disease is likely to progress.The impacts of the project will be twofold. For patients and doctors, the tests will ensure that patients are diagnosed earlier and more easily.

MARCAR,,,Novartis,Closed,01/01/2010,30/06/2015,IMI1,1,Group Cross,Biomarkers and molecular tumour classification for non-genotoxic carcinogenesis,Cancer:Tools for predicting/monitoring efficacy:3Rs - animal use in research:Imaging,RIA (Research and Innovation Action),115001,6 049 578,5 155 604,,1 905 508,"One of the key questions scientists ask during early drug development is: could a potential drug cause cancer? MARCAR project scientists set out to discover early biological indicators which could help detect some of the more indirect ways in which drugs cause tumour formation. During the project, they discovered several potential biological indicators and a wealth of knowledge which could make drugs safer and decrease the time it takes for innovative drugs to reach patients. Additionally, one of the imaging techniques developed during the project has the potential to significantly reduce the number of animals used in the early stages of drug development.
When it comes to the development of innovative medicines, one of the main challenges is cancer risk assessment, i.e. ensuring that the potential drug does not cause cancer. There are two ways in which drugs can induce cancer: by directly altering the structure of the DNA and causing genetic mutations (genotoxic), and by various other indirect mechanisms which are harder to identify (non-genotoxic). While genotoxic changes are quick and generally easy to detect during the early stages of the drug development process, non-genotoxic changes require more intensive studies that utilize a large number of laboratory animals (approximately 500 per drug), and carry a very significant financial burden (about €3 million per drug). Due to this long and laborious process, many developed compounds either do not reach the market, or carry drug label warnings for potential carcinogenic risk due to the observation of cancerous effects in preclinical laboratory (e.g. animal) studies.The goal of the MARCAR project was to develop early biological indicators (biomarkers), for early detection of non-genotoxic carcinogenesis. This type of cancer formation is thought to be facilitated by ‘epigenetic’ changes, i.e. modifications of the DNA and proteins that surround and functionally organize the DNA in our cells. Changes in these molecules can alter the 'readability' of the DNA and so affect the activity of our genes. The MARCAR consortium set out to shed more light on these epigenetic effects, using a combination of novel and sophisticated molecular technologies. Combining their expertise in the field of biomarkers, human and rodent cancer models, imaging, molecular profiling and bioinformatics, the researchers initially focused on liver tumours, an organ that is frequently affected by non-genotoxic carcinogenesis during the preclinical safety evaluation of medicines.Project success: New potential epigenetic biomarkers identifiedEarly efforts in MARCAR focused on optimising methods and technologies which allow scientists to look into the relationship between drug exposure and measurable epigenetic changes in liver cells transitioning to a tumour. Once a methodology was established, the consortium partners dug deeper to determine which specific epigenetic changes were linked with tumour growth. The goal was to identify early epigenetic biomarkers which could signal that a specific drug might cause non-genotoxic changes, and ultimately create an environment in which cancer occurs. At least two classes of such potential biomarkers were identified.Early in the project, MARCAR scientists discovered a promising early RNA biomarker called Meg3 that originates from a very special epigenetically-regulated region of the genome. Progressive activation of Meg3 by non-genotoxic carcinogens in mice is believed to reflect reprogramming of normal adult liver cells towards a stem cell-like pluripotent state, a change which might contribute to the development of cancer in the longer-term. This biomarker is currently being evaluated with a broader range of drugs and has the potential to explain the molecular basis of species differences in responses to non-genotoxic carcinogens, a key consideration for interpreting human relevance of animal studies.Another very important clue came from looking at the DNA bases or letters that make up the genetic code. Although basic biology teaches us that there are four basic DNA bases (A, T, C and G), multiple epigenetic modifications of the C (“cytosine”) base dramatically increase the complexity of our genes. MARCAR project scientists focused on a recently discovered modified form of cytosine called 5-hydroxymethylcytosine which is epigenetic in nature because it is involved in regulating the activity of genes, i.e. switching them on and off. They were able to show that this modified base is altered in very specific patterns by exposure to drugs which are known to cause liver cancer in rodents. On this basis, the scientists postulated that 5-hydroxymethylcytosine represents a powerful early biomarker for predicting tumour growth.Both of these novel biomarker discoveries have the potential to underpin the design of improved preclinical safety studies that should ultimately reduce the cost, and accelerate the development of, innovative medicines.Mouse MRI to reduce number of animals used in testingIn pre-clinical trials, in order to track tumour growth in animals, scientists have to look at the tissue directly, and this means sacrificing the animal. MARCAR project scientists developed a new method which is non-invasive and thus dramatically reduces the number of animals that need to be used for mechanistic carcinogenicity studies. The method involves a special magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique which allows researchers to scan mice and locate tiny tumours early in the screening process that are just 1 mm in size. They can then track the subsequent growth of the tumours by rescanning the same animals instead of having to sacrifice them every time. The method holds great value in reducing the number of animals used in drug development.  Innovation in animal models: a mouse with a human receptorAnother innovation focused on a well-characterised epilepsy drug, which causes cancer in mice, but not in humans. In order to shed more light on this discrepancy, MARCAR scientists inserted a human receptor for this drug into the body of a mouse, creating a ‘humanised mouse’ model. They wanted to see if the human receptor would work in the body of the mouse, and if it would lead to the formation of cancer; it did, but with a reduced incidence. Does that mean that the drug is carcinogenic for humans after all? It’s not so simple because the tumour growth still occurred in the body of a mouse. However, the use of this humanised mouse model could be useful in the further study of the mechanisms of how cancer develops.For the benefit of the industry, patients and academiaThe science, technology and models developed during the MARCAR project have the potential to strengthen the scientific rigour and strength of cancer risk assessment; improve drug safety; reduce animal use and reduce the time it takes for new innovative medicines reach patients. Furthermore, the biobank and database created during the project will be assets in future research.What next?Now that the project has drawn to a close, one of the priorities will be to share the knowledge gained with the global community. This will be done in a multitude of conferences and workshops.  Read the interview with project coordinator","Bayer Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany:Boehringer Ingelheim Internationalgmbh, Ingelheim, Germany:H.

MIP-DILI ,,,#N/A,Closed,01/02/2012,31/03/2017,IMI1,3,Group Standard,Mechanism-Based Integrated Systems for the Prediction of Drug-Induced Liver Injury,,RIA (Research and Innovation Action),115336,15 335 538,12 648 466,,4 335 862,"Many medicines are harmful to the liver, and drug-induced liver injury (DILI) ranks as one of the leading cause of liver failure and transplantation in western countries. However, predicting which drugs will prove toxic to the liver is extremely difficult, and often problems are not detected until a drug is already on the market. IMI’s MIP-DILI project deepened the understanding of the science behind drug-induced liver injury, and improved laboratory tests which are used to predict DILI in the early stages of drug development. This is already helping pharmaceutical companies to make better decisions on which drug molecule to take forward into further research, saving time and resources, and helping ensure that only the safest and most promising drugs reach patients.   Clinicians and drug manufacturers recognise two kinds of DILI. Dose-dependent DILI is usually detected early on in drug development and, as the name suggests, the risk of an adverse reaction increases with the dosage. However, some DILIs are so-called idiosyncratic reactions. These cannot be predicted in experimental systems, occur only in certain patients, and are not clearly dose dependent toxicities. Very often, idiosyncratic DILI problems are only picked up very late in drug development or even after regulatory approval. Estimates suggest that one in seven cases of liver failure are triggered by an adverse drug reaction in patients.The goal of MIP-DILI was to dramatically improve the tools used to test for liver toxicity in early drug development, especially in vitro tests which measure the effect of potential drug molecules on human cell systems in a laboratory setting. By bringing together Europe’s top industrial and academic experts in the field for the first time, the project deepened our understanding of the science behind drug-induced liver injury, and then used that knowledge to overcome the many drawbacks of the laboratory tests currently used.Looking at existing models and developing new onesOne of the main project achievements was a systematic and evidence-based evaluation of both currently available and new laboratory test systems, including cultures of liver cells in one-dimensional and three dimensional configurations. MIP-DILI really took an in-depth look into how all these cell systems function and developed definitions of basic biological machinery in various in vitro test systems to see which human processes they are capable of capturing.The project also developed models that capture the principal types of liver injury that these in vitro systems can detect. This is important because while some cases of DILI may be triggered by something inside the liver cells, others appear to be associated with external factors, including the immune system and viral infections.  These factors also need to be taken into account in laboratory tests.Thanks to MIP-DILI, scientists working to develop new drugs now have a more realistic and physiologically relevant set of models for looking at a defined set of chemical attacks that drugs can make on liver cells. This gives them a warning of this toxicity very early in the drug development process, so that they can focus their efforts on those molecules which can arrive safely to patients.Other important achievementsIn addition to the above, the project recorded a number of other achievements, including:An ability to detect a major sub-type of human DILI (called cholestasis) by a new mechanism which involves bile formation and flow. This has never been achieved before and was a breakthrough in this field of research.A roadmap for the evaluation of DILI test systems. Developed for the evaluation of test systems within the project, this roadmap will help future projects as well.Development of a battery of preclinical test systems for detecting DILI, which are fit for purpose.Determination of what can – and what cannot – be predicted with current DILI test systems in order to inform drug development, regulators and the public.New understanding of the mechanisms of fialuridine toxicity (experimental drug for hepatitis B), including the first-ever evidence that some of the existing in vitro tests can successfully predict this toxicity.A roadmap to understand and assess potential DILI liabilities of new drugs during their development.A clearer identification of remaining knowledge gaps which need to be addressed in order to advance this field of research.Considerable benefits for patientsAlthough DILI is rare, when it happens, it is often extremely serious or even fatal for the patient concerned. Yet drugs that pose a risk of DILI still make it to the market, and DILI is a common reason for withdrawing drugs from national prescription registries. By helping researchers to detect DILI problems during drug research, before drugs are evaluated in clinical trials and approved for use, MIP-DILI will greatly contribute to the considerable efforts being made to avoid pain and suffering on the part of patients as a consequence of these adverse drug reactions.The project will also help patients in therapeutic areas where there is an urgent need for new drugs. One of the biggest risks in the development of a new drug is that at a late stage, after four or five years of endeavour, that drug has to be stopped because of a problem with drug safety. The tools developed within MIP-DILI will help reduce this risk, enabling pharmaceutical companies to focus their efforts on the most promising drugs.For the benefit of academia and industry
 
Academic partners in the project benefited from access to reference compounds with known liver toxicity, as well as from gaining a deeper insight into industry practices and needs. Additionally, the gap analysis performed within the project revealed the need for more fundamental research in some areas, which will be a fertile training ground for future PhD students and post-doctoral fellows.For their part, pharmaceutical companies gained a greater understanding of the complex science behind DILI, and an appreciation that the mechanisms of DILI need to be better understood before drug toxicities, especially those associated with an immune response, can ever be predicted in patients.Thanks to IMI, the pharmaceutical companies worked on these issues in a precompetitive space for the first time, openly sharing questions that they all have in their respective companies. There was also a tremendous benefit in working with academia to tackle these questions and find solutions which can be deployed within industry. Many of the tools and learnings developed in this project are already deployed in industry, and have resulted in both cost and time savings.The SMEs in the project gained a unique opportunity to work with both industry and academia to develop their tools and test their products. Thanks to the network created within the project, they were then able to offer those products to industry customers. SMEs also participated in the project’s joint publications, which gave them visibility and increased their reputation in the wider scientific community.Reducing the use of animals in researchEverything about MIP-DILI has worked towards encouraging a reduction in the use of animals in preclinical research. By helping improve the value of in vitro tools in early drug discovery, MIP-DILI improved the decision making process, ensuring that only the best and most promising molecules are brought forward into further trials on animals.  What’s next?All the foreground and background data generated during the lifetime of the project is stored within a database, and will continue to be sustained by one of the SMEs in the project. The project’s sustainability will also be ensured through the in vitro tests which were developed within the project and are now in use in both industry and academia.Read the interview with project coordinators","Abbvie Deutschland GMBH & Co Kg, Wiesbaden, Germany:Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Corp, Princeton, NJ, United States :Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Basingstoke, United Kingdom:Glaxosmithkline Research And Development LTD., Brentford, Middlesex, United Kingdom:H.

Mofina,,,DH-PHE,Closed,01/02/2015,30/04/2017,IMI2,2,Group Standard,Mobile Filovirus Nucleic Acid Test,Infectious diseases:Ebola and related diseases:Diagnostics:Ebola+,RIA (Research and Innovation Action),115848,1 162 622,,3 235 630,4 398 252,"The Mofina project developed a new, portable diagnostic test that will deliver results in under 75 minutes on whether a patient has Ebola or a related disease such as Marburg virus. The device is designed to work in sites where high-end laboratory infrastructures are not available, and so will help to contain outbreaks and save lives.The 2014-15 Ebola epidemic was unprecedented in its scale and geographical distribution. By the middle of 2015, World Health Organization (WHO) statistics recorded over 27 000 cases and 11 000 deaths from the disease, most of them in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.One of the biggest challenges in containing an Ebola outbreak is quick and efficient diagnosis. Until now, patients who were suspected of having the virus had to be taken to treatment centres far away from their communities and kept in isolation centres until tests confirmed that they were not infected. Even if they were found to be healthy and subsequently released, they were often stigmatised in their local communities, as others feared that they may have been exposed to the virus. This caused psychological stress and trauma, spreading fear in local communities, and making it harder to contain outbreaks. Some people who developed symptoms would even avoid or hide from the Ebola tracing teams as they feared being ostracised.IMI’s Mofina project developed a portable device, no bigger than a shoe box, which can be used for diagnosing all known Ebola virus strains as well as Marburg virus in the field. The testing is easy, safe, reliable, and can be performed by people with little training such as local health care workers, saving money and resources. All that is needed to perform the test is a simple prick of a finger.  The product has been validated, CE-IVD marked and is already commercially available. This is the first commercially available test that is both portable and can test for all the known Ebola virus strains. It is anticipated that potential buyers could include public health institutes, diagnostic services, WHO and non-governmental organisations tackling outbreaks.Cooperation with key partners According to the project partners, the success of this project would not have been possible without the collaboration between the public and private partners, brought together by IMI.For example, the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) within the project, Altona Diagnostics, contributed by bringing in their diagnostic test for all the different strains of Ebola that was validated and could be used in a normal lab setting. Another private partner, Alere Technologies, brought in a molecular diagnosis platform which is already used across Africa for HIV testing in the field. It is by combining those two technologies that the project partners were able to develop a unique new test which is both portable and can test for of the known Ebola virus strains.Furthermore, thanks to the collaboration with the national public health institutes and other public partners, the project was able to validate the device on patient samples collected during the west African Ebola outbreak, and get it quickly approved for placement on the market.Benefits for industry, SMEs, and patientsThe industry benefitted from the collaboration with SMEs and the public partners in the consortium, such as leading European public health institutions.The SME in the project benefitted from getting a detailed insight into workflows in mobile laboratories during outbreaks which will help them in developing future products. They also benefitted from fostering existing scientific collaborations, and establishing new ones.However, it will be the patients who will benefit the most. The device produced by Mofina will help contain Ebola outbreaks in the future, by identifying infected patients much sooner than before.What comes next?The project partners would like to develop the device further, making it possible to test for a range of other infectious diseases, which are on the list of WHO priority pathogens, such as the Zika virus, dengue and Lassa fever.  Read the interview with the project coordinator","Bernhard-Nocht-Institut Fuer Tropenmedizin, Hamburg, Germany:Department of Health, Leeds, United Kingdom:Foundation For Innovative New Diagnostics, Geneva, Switzerland:Istituto Nazionale Per Le Malattie Infettive Lazzaro Spallanzani-Istituto Di Ricovero E Cura A Carattere Scientifico, Rome, Italy","Altona Diagnostics GMBH, Hamburg, Germany","Alere Technologies GMBH, Jena, Germany",,,Altona Diagnostics GMBH:394 178:Bernhard-Nocht-Institut Fuer Tropenmedizin:217 992:Department of Health:332 460:Istituto Nazionale Per Le Malattie Infettive Lazzaro Spallanzani-Istituto Di Ricovero E Cura A Carattere Scientifico:217 992:Total Cost:1 162 622,NA,Yes,"IMI: Colm Carroll

It can be triggered in various ways, including through surgery, injury, diabetes, chemotherapy, and viral infection. Existing treatments are only effective in a minority of patients. Furthermore, treatments address the symptoms, not the underlying causes of the pain, and so are not curative. In fact, the underlying causes of neuropathic pain are still poorly understood, and that’s where the NGN-PET project comes in.The NGN-PET team will focus its efforts on interactions between nerve cells (neurons) and glial cells (also known as glia). There are many types of glia, and their role in the nervous system includes supporting nerve cells, insulating them, and providing them with nutrients and oxygen. Recent research has revealed that glial cells are actively involved in the development of sensory abnormalities, including pain.NGN-PET aims to explore neuron-glial interactions in neuropathic pain caused by chemotherapy or trauma by developing advanced neuron-glia cell cultures based on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The outcome of the project will be a high throughput screening platform that can then be used to rapidly test potential treatments and will ultimately pave the way for the development of safe, effective pain treatments.","Abbvie Deutschland GMBH & Co Kg, Wiesbaden, Germany:Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Basingstoke, United Kingdom:F.

Onco Track,pilot,Bayer ,BAYER,Closed,01/01/2011,31/12/2016,IMI1,2,Group Chronic diseases,Methods for systematic next generation oncology biomarker development ,Cancer:Tools for predicting/monitoring safety,RIA (Research and Innovation Action),115234,16 757 282,10 976 557,,3 346 480,"Colorectal cancers are a very heterogeneous group of cancers and not all of them respond to the same drugs in the same way. By collecting tumour samples from patients and then analysing them in the laboratory, the OncoTrack project found molecular fingerprints of those tumours and then correlated them to how these tumours respond to various drugs. The project’s outputs are already helping doctors in choosing the right treatment for the right patient, and could also help in the future search for more effective drugs. As a result of the project, two spin out companies have been created and several patents filed, demonstrating tangible socio-economic benefits.
Colorectal cancer is the third most frequently occurring cancer worldwide and, at an advanced stage, one of the most common causes of death. It takes numerous forms, and not all cancers respond to the same kind of treatment. This is because tumours undergo genetic changes as they grow and spread, and these changes can vary even between patients with the same type of cancer.  To be able to predict a tumour’s response to certain drugs more accurately, IMI’s OncoTrack project set out to produce molecular fingerprints of different tumours and correlate the different fingerprints to how the tumours respond to various drugs.By bringing together academic institutions, SMEs and pharmaceutical companies, OncoTrack scientists first collected tumour samples from over 100 colorectal cancer patients at different stages of the disease. They grew these tumours in tissue culture systems, as well as in special mouse strains, and proceeded to analyse them in the lab. In particular, the scientists looked for biomarkers, i.e. molecules that are typical of the different tumour sub-groups. Based on this analysis, they were able to produce molecular fingerprints for all of the tumours.Next, they tested how the tumours respond to different drugs and correlated various tumour fingerprints with their response to the different clinical compounds. Among other things, they discovered two biomarkers that can predict the effectiveness of two drugs commonly used to treat this disease: Cetuximab, which inhibits the receptor for the epidermal growth factor, and the chemotherapy drug 5FU.New 3D models of colon cancer, and other achievementsGrowth of tumours took place in 3D tissue culture systems and through xenografts – tissue grafted onto mice, which creates a strain of the disease adapted to mice. Analysis covered the genetic material, RNA molecules and in some cases, the proteins of the tumours. These biological models are now considered as some of the best characterised in the field, and are already being used by pharmaceutical companies in their drug discovery and development projects.Other important outputs generated by the project include:a biorepository of patient-derived 3D cultures and patient-derived xenograft models;a database which contains part of the data generated by the project, with plans to complete it in the near future.Two spin outs and various patents The project also resulted in two spin-out companies. One of them was created in 2014 to commercialise the technology of 3D tissue culture systems or organoids. Generated from the tumour tissue, organoids are groups of cells that grow in the culture dish, remain small, and mimic a lot of the biology of the tumour. They are potentially quite useful to pharma companies and this spin-out has been set up to commercialise this as a basis for drug testing.The second company was set up in 2018. It spun out from a group at the University of Paris, and intends to commercialise OncoTrack’s technologies developed to improve diagnostic procedures.One of the major goals of OncoTrack was also to find better ways to diagnose cancer, and some of the partners have refined the technologies that they have been using. Several patents have been filed as a result.Benefits to patientsOncoTrack project outputs are already benefitting patients. For example, the analysis of tumour samples of more than 100 patients, which was done as part of this project, is now available to the doctors treating those patients. Furthermore, for drugs which are already used in the clinic, such mutation analysis is now becoming routine, helping doctors choose the right drug for the right patient.Additionally, one of the academic partners, the Medical University in Graz, is using the 3D culture models, which were developed during the project, in an experimental setting in the clinic in order to find drugs that can potentially help patients for whom no treatment is available.For the benefit of industry, academia and SMEsThe academic institutions in the project benefitted from access to the pharmaceutical companies’ resources, such as drugs which were tested during the project. They also got a lot more information about mechanisms of drug action then they otherwise would have. In turn, the pharmaceutical industry is benefitting from the information, materials and biological models developed during the project.Both academia and industry partners gained a lot from collaborating and exchanging different viewpoints and perspectives. For example, academics have learned more about how the industry works, and the industry has benefited from academic expertise. The connections which have been established will last well into the future.Finally, the SMEs in the project benefitted from increased visibility and reputation, as well as new contacts with both industry and academic partners. Participating in OncoTrack accelerated their business expansion and helped them enter into new markets.What’s next?The information and models created during OncoTrack are now available for future research projects. In fact, several OncoTrack partners are continuing to work together in new pan-European projects, such as the Future Health initiative. Additional new projects, funded by national or local agencies, have been initiated by some of the academic partners.  Read the interview with project coordinators",,,,,,Alacris Theranostics GmbH:5 698 658:Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin:1 373 584:Dahlem Centre for Genome Research and Medical Systems Biology:42 000:Experimentelle Pharmakologie Und Onkologie Berlin-Buch GMBH:697 830:Gabo:Mi Gesellschaft Fur Ablauforganisation:Milliarium mbH & Co.

Until now, these data sources were very fragmented and it took researchers significant amounts of time and money to answer basic research questions. IMI’s Open PHACTS project addressed this gap by creating a platform that connects about a dozen different drug discovery databases, allowing researchers to rapidly find and access relevant data in different domains. Thanks to the Open PHACTS Foundation, which was set up during the project, the platform is free, open access and sustainable, and will continue to run beyond the lifetime of the project.Drug discovery is data-hungry and all major pharmaceutical companies maintain extensive in-house instances of public data. Analysis and hypothesis generation for drug-discovery projects requires the assembly, overlay and comparison of data from many sources as well as the development of shared identifiers and common semantics. The alignment and integration of internal and public data and information sources requires a significant effort, and the process is repeated across companies, institutes and academic laboratories. This represents a significant waste and increases drug discovery costs. The Open PHACTS project set out to tackle that challenge.By bringing together leading experts in the fields of data mining, small molecule data storage and manipulation, target bioinformatics, information handling, chemical biology and more, the project developed the Open PHACTS Discovery Platform. The platform links up about a dozen diverse and complementary drug discovery databases, allowing researchers to rapidly find and access relevant data in different domains, such as compounds, targets, diseases and tissues. It is open to all users and is freely available in the public domain. The platform significantly reduces the time needed to answer complex questions in drug discovery: what used to take days or months of research, can now be accessed with a few clicks.Leading the way in data standardisationIn order to make all this data more searchable, the project also developed standards and common identifiers. Moreover, the project was a thought incubator for the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reproducible) data principles, which are now having a wider impact on the scientific community.A spin off that will reduce the use of animals in researchThe project also resulted in the creation of a spin off. Called Phenaris, it will develop ToxPHACTS, a software that will combine the eTOX project outputs with the Open PHACTS discovery platform.The ToxPHACTS platform will allow toxicologists to do the very early assessment of the risk of a certain compound, even before they do the first animal experiments. The new platform will save researches money and time, and reduce the use of animals in research.For the benefit of industry, academia and SMEsBoth industry and academia benefitted from the collaboration and the intellectual network which was created during this project.The academic community also greatly benefited from getting to know how industry works, especially when it comes to data issues. Several PhD students who worked in the project found jobs in industry.The SMEs within the project benefitted from close contacts with potential new customers in industry and from learning more about their needs.What’s nextEven though the project has ended, the Open PHACTS Discovery Platform lives on thanks to the Open PHACTS Foundation, which was set up to build on the work begun in the project. The foundation was set up early in the project, in 2012, and the formal handover from project to foundation took place at the project’s closing meeting in Vienna in 2016. Meanwhile the foundation has already established itself as a leader in linking data, and is a partner in several Horizon 2020 projects.Read the interview with project coordinators","Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Bayer Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany:Boehringer Ingelheim Internationalgmbh, Ingelheim, Germany:Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Basingstoke, United Kingdom:F.

However, designing these pharmaceutical products in such a way that the active ingredient is absorbed at an appropriate rate and extent by the gut is far from easy. The ORBITO project aims to enhance our understanding of how orally-administered drugs are taken up from the gastrointestinal tract into the body, and apply this knowledge to create new laboratory tests and computer models that will better predict the performance of these drugs in patients.
Predicting performanceThe majority of drug products are administered orally, yet designing oral formulations and determining dosages involves a lot of trial and error. Current laboratory tests do not mimic accurately the highly variable and dynamic environment of the human gut, and so their ability to predict the performance of an orally-administered drug in the human body is limited. As a result, researchers rely heavily on tests in animals and clinical studies in humans to verify drug performance, rendering the entire process rather lengthy and expensive. The issue is likely to become even more pressing in the future as new drug discovery technologies are increasingly delivering active drugs that are very hard to put into simple oral formulations, for example because they are hydrophobic, have low aqueous solubility, and/or variable uptake in large intestine.There is therefore an urgent need for improved tools to predict the performance of orally-administered drugs.From trial and error to rational modelsThe ORBITO project aims to tackle this problem at all levels, beginning with improving our fundamental understanding of the gastro-intestinal absorption process. This information will be integrated into the development of new (or refinement of existing) laboratory tests and computer-based methods that will deliver more accurate predictions of drug product behaviour in real life. The new methods will be validated with the use of industrial data and material. Crucially, the project will set up a framework to guide the use of these new tools in drug development.What sets ORBITO apart from other projects is the way it will integrate data from many existing studies while also initiating new studies that will generate better data. By combining existing data with new data, and by bringing together so many different partners, it has a good chance of achieving its goals.Ultimately, the project will help to facilitate and speed up the formulation development process and significantly reduce the need for animal experiments in this area as well as for human clinical studies in the future.For patients, the main benefit will be in the form of high quality medicines where the dose required is well calculated and is released in a way that consistently provides an optimal clinical effect.","Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Basingstoke, United Kingdom:Esteve Pharmaceuticals, SA, Barcelona, Spain:Glaxosmithkline Research And Development LTD., Brentford, Middlesex, United Kingdom:H.

The multi-disciplinary team will focus on three major areas. Firstly, they will set up a comprehensive clinical research programme to study the immune response of people of all ages to pertussis infection and vaccination. Secondly, they will establish tools (clinical and pre-clinical models) to study pertussis infection. Finally, they will develop a battery of state-of-the-art tests, to help reveal the markers of an effective and long-lasting immune response to pertussis infection.

The outbreak highlighted the urgent need for safe, effective vaccines against the highly infectious disease.There are a number of promising Ebola vaccines in development, and studies suggest that they are both safe and effective. Nevertheless, their large-scale deployment could be limited by issues such as the fact that they need to be stored at extremely low temperatures (-80°C). The goal of the PEVIA project is to develop second generation Ebola vaccines based on the proteins found on the surface of the virus. The project team is using the prime-boost approach, in which one vaccine is given to prime the immune system, and a second (different) vaccine is given to boost the immune response. The project hopes that the resulting regimen will be better suited to large-scale vaccination programmes in sub-Saharan countries, most notably because it will not require storage at low temperatures. In addition, PEVIA aims to develop innovative tools and methods to facilitate the development of new vaccine candidates for Ebola and related diseases, as well as novel diagnostic tests that can be deployed in the field.","GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium:Sanofi Pasteur SA, Lyon, France","Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden, Leiden, Netherlands:Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, Lausanne, Switzerland:Commissariat A L Energie Atomique Et Aux Energies Alternatives, Paris, France:Department of Health, Leeds, United Kingdom:Institut Pasteur De Lille Fondation, Lille, France:London School Of Hygiene And Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom:Mikrobiologicky Ustav - Avcr, V.V.I., Prague 4, Czech Republic:Rijksinstituut Voor Volksgezondheid En Milieu, Bilthoven, Netherlands:Stichting Katholieke Universiteit, Nijmegen, Netherlands:Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland:Universidad De Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain:Universitat Basel, Basel, Switzerland:University Of Bath, Bath, United Kingdom:University Of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom:University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom:University of Turku, Turku, Finland:Université Libre de Bruxelles, Bruxelles, Belgium","Eurice European Research And Project Office GMBH, Saarbrücken, Germany:Q-Biologicals Nv, Gent, Belgium","Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, United States",,,http://www.pevia-ebola.eu,#N/A,#N/A,"Estelle ZIEGLER,

Pharma-Cog,,,GSK,Closed,01/01/2010,31/12/2015,IMI1,1,Group Neurodegenerative diseases,Prediction of cognitive properties of new drug candidates for neurodegenerative diseases in early clinical development,Neurodegenerative diseases:Alzheimer's disease:Tools for predicting/monitoring safety:Clinical trial design:Drug discovery,RIA (Research and Innovation Action),115009,9 658 388,11 690 333,,9 366 835,"_______When it comes to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), most potential drug candidates fail during clinical trials, resulting in significant setbacks in the development of effective treatments. IMI’s Pharma-Cog project set out to change that. The project developed a matrix of biomarkers which can be used to study the effect of a drug candidate both in animals and humans, and has the potential to more accurately predict the success of future drugs in early stages of drug development. Pharma-Cog scientists also found a better way to stratify patients with early signs of Alzheimer’s disease, which may lead to more definitive clinical trials. All this has the potential to help pharmaceutical companies conduct more efficient and more precise clinical trials in the future, speeding up the development of AD drugs. At least one biotech company is already using the results of Pharma-Cog to test a promising new drug candidate.A challenging diseaseOver 4 million Europeans suffer from Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and the cost of the disease in the EU amounted to more than 100 billion in 2008. Currently approved drugs for patients with Alzheimer's disease only treat symptoms (symptomatic approach) and their effect is limited or absent in many patients. No drugs have been approved yet that can actually slow the progression of the disease (disease modifying approach). Trials with candidate drugs take years and cost tens of millions of euros. Furthermore, a number of AD drugs which showed promise in the laboratory didn’t translate into success in the clinic, resulting in a high number of costly drug failures.The Pharma-Cog project aimed to develop and validate new tools to test candidate drugs for the treatment of symptoms and disease in a faster and more sensitive way. By bringing together results from blood tests, electroencephalography (EEG) recording of brain activity, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and behavioural tests, the scientists set out to develop a more comprehensive matrix of clues (biomarkers) that may give more accurate information on the progression of the disease and the effect of candidate drugs than current approaches. The project worked in three core areas: preclinical work with animal models; experimental medicine work involving healthy volunteers that undergo a challenge, such as sleep deprivation; and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), an early sign of Alzheimer’s.Improving translatability between animals, healthy volunteers and patientsIn order to find biomarkers which could help predict the effectiveness of a new drug candidate in the early stages of drug development, Pharma-Cog scientists measured the effect of known Alzheimer’s drugs in all three core areas above. By cross-checking the results, they identified and validated a matrix of biomarkers, such as EEG recordings of brain activity and MRI scans, which could help predict the effect of drugs more accurately. For example, they demonstrated that some changes in the rhythm of brain activity observed via EEG are a good marker to detect the effect of a new drug in early studies involving both human and animal models. This important discovery could help pharmaceutical companies make better decisions on which drugs are worth pursuing in clinical trials, and do this much earlier, before starting the more costly studies in patients. A French biotechnology small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) is already using some of these findings to evaluate a promising new AD drug candidate.Improving stratification of patientsAn important part of the project was a study involving more than 150 patients with MCI. MCI is one of the early signs of Alzheimer’s but not all patients who have it will go on to develop the disease. In clinical studies involving MCI patients, the effect of a potential drug candidate can be masked by this variability among patients.By monitoring a group of MCI patients over a longer period of time, and taking measurements such as EEG readings, MRI scans and blood tests, Pharma-Cog scientists were able to identify a set of biomarkers which signal whether a patient is likely to progress to Alzheimer’s or not. This important discovery has the potential to improve the stratification of AD patients in future clinical trials, making it more sensitive and effective.Other achievementsIn addition to improving translatability between animal and human studies, and improving the stratification of patients, the project recorded a number of other achievements, including:Reconciling the symptomatic and disease modifying approaches to AD therapy, and highlighting the need for improved symptomatic drugs despite the emphasis on disease modification.Building a large database which contains data on the effect of AD drugs on a matrix of biomarkers. As some studies are still ongoing, this database is currently open to only Pharma-Cog partners, but it will eventually be opened up to other researchers.Demonstration that healthy humans and animals who have been sleep-deprived for one night show some of the same changes in brain activity as AD patients, and can be used in early studies to predict the effectiveness of new drug candidates.Thanks to Pharma-Cog, a French SME was able to validate a diagnostic kit for AD, which they had developed before the project. The kit contains inflammatory proteins which show correlation with the worsening of the disease. A patent application is pending.As the European Medicines Agency was a full partner in the project, the findings could have an impact on the revision of EMA guidelines on medicines for Alzheimer’s. Discussions with the agency are still ongoing.Strengthening collaboration between key players in the Alzheimer’s disease field, including industry, academia and SMEs. The collaboration is continuing and could result in future projects.For the benefit of industry, academia, and patientsThe academic partners benefited from the project by gaining international visibility, strengthening their collaboration with industry and learning more about the drug development process, including the high standards of robustness and rigour of data that industry requires before further investment into novel drugs or technologies. Many publications and communications have also resulted from the project.The industry also benefited from the collaboration with academia, SMEs and other industry partners. In the long term, the outputs of Pharma-Cog could help pharmaceutical companies make better decisions on which drugs are worth pursuing in clinical trials, saving them money and resources. Additionally, the stratification of patients devised in Pharma-Cog could make clinical trials more sensitive.But it will be the patients who will benefit the most. Thanks to Pharma-Cog, future clinical trials may require smaller sample sizes and shorter duration, which could speed up the development of new AD drugs for the benefit of patients.Thanks to the participation of a patient organisation, Alzheimer Europe, as a full partner in the project, Pharma-Cog also enabled patients to gain a better understanding of the drug development process and the challenges of predicting the safety and efficacy of new molecules.What’s next?Even though the project has officially ended, several studies are still ongoing and further publications are anticipated. Furthermore, some of the partners within the project are continuing to collaborate and apply for new projects.Read the interview with project coordinators","Abbvie Deutschland GMBH & Co Kg, Wiesbaden, Germany:Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Basingstoke, United Kingdom:F.

The project also developed quality criteria and processes to evaluate universities offering these courses, as well as individual courses. All this is already raising the quality of education in these fields across Europe and beyond, forming the basis for structured competence development. Ultimately, uniform high-level training and education in Europe will make the drug development process faster, more economical, more tailored to patients’ needs, and will give Europe a global advantage in developing new innovative medicines.Europe needs experts in the pharmaceutical industry who are able to oversee the entire medicines development process, from the identification of a molecule, through pre-clinical and clinical trials, all the way to the regulatory process and market approval. Yet  education and training in these fields has been quite fragmented in Europe. The aim of PharmaTrain was to bring together all the experts who are teaching this subject and make them agree on the content that should be taught when someone wants to become a specialist in these areas. The project also wanted to ensure that post-graduate training courses that are offered across Europe have the same quality, delivering the same type of learning effect, no matter where the training is carried out.By bringing together 20 university training programmes, 10 learned societies, 3 competent authorities, several partner training organisations and 15 pharmaceutical companies, PharmaTrain managed to achieve all its objectives. One of its main achievements was to create common standards and guidelines for universities who want to develop training in medicines development, regulatory affairs, clinical trials, investigator training and clinical trial management. The partners also developed a set of criteria which can be used to recognise and assess the quality of available courses in these fields, along with labels which can be awarded to programmes which meet the required standards. Thanks to this system, the project developed a network of 13 courses which are now recognised as Centres of Excellence, and evaluated more than 150 short courses.More specifically, the project delivered the following outputs:a syllabus and curricula for medicines development;a concept for professional certification in medicines development, which has already been implemented in Italy and Japan as a pilot;a joint postgraduate course in medicines development, which is offered by 10 cooperating regional universities, mostly in eastern Europe;syllabus and learning outcomes for 26 elective modules in medicines development;9 e-learning compact modules which are freely available;a good examination practice guide;a concept for a post-graduate, on-the-job certification programme leading to a ’specialist in medicines development’;a syllabus and curriculum for a postgraduate master of regulatory affairs;a clinical investigator training concept.For the benefit of industry, academia and patientsFor the academic community, this project represented a unique opportunity to come together, join forces and agree on shared quality standards for training in medicines development, regulatory affairs and investigator training. It was also an opportunity to adapt their courses to the needs of the industry.The industry benefited by getting employees who have a more integrated view of the needs in research and development and can be more easily integrated into companies. They have also benefitted from the network which was established during the project.Ultimately, it will be the patients who will benefit, as the new, higher quality training standards will result in better trained medicines development professionals, which in turn will lead to better and safer medicines for patients.What’s next?After the end of the project, all the partners have agreed to donate project outcomes to the new PharmaTrain Federation, a non-profit organisation which was established to continue some of the project’s work. The federation is self-sustaining through membership fees, and among other things, it continues to asses courses offered in the medicines development field.

Inflammatory autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus affect 1-3% of the population, and while treatments exist, these are costly and have a number of serious side effects. There is growing evidence that many of these conditions may be incorrectly classified. The PRECISESADS project will study 2 500 people with various autoimmune diseases, gathering data on the molecular causes of their disease as well as their clinical symptoms. Using this information, they will pave the way for a new classification of these diseases, something that will allow doctors to offer patients more personalised treatments at an earlier stage of their disease.
Chronic inflammatory autoimmune disorders like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are found in 1-3% of the general population. They are particularly prevalent in women, with SLE affecting nine times more women than men. Symptoms of these diseases can be severe, and patients need regular check-ups. For example, symptoms of lupus include painful, swollen joints, fever, rashes, fatigue, and sensitivity to the sun. There are few treatments available for these diseases; most receive steroids, which are associated with serious side effects including an increased propensity to infections, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease.In addition, these diseases are difficult to diagnose early enough in the disease process to prevent severe or even fatal outcomes. In some cases, it can take – six to eight years from the onset of symptoms to arrive at a diagnosis. This can also have a significant impact on the psychological well-being of the patient.New and promising biological treatments are being developed for SLE, but it is not always clear which lupus patients will benefit from which treatment, plus separate disease classification means that they cannot be used to treat other autoimmune diseases which researchers believe share a similar molecular basis. In fact, the pharmaceutical companies face major problems in trying to identify tests to determine the usefulness of drugs in clinical trials. A new classification of inflammatory diseasesBy establishing a Europe-wide, large-scale team, PRECISESADS will provide new data to offer a more appropriate classification of these patients. The project will analyse in great detail blood and urine samples of 2 500 people with a range of systemic autoimmune diseases, as well as patients with suspected autoimmune disease who don’t have a diagnosis because they do not fulfil current clinical criteria for any of the systemic autoimmune diseases. Through the analysis of these patients’ data, the project hopes to be able to define clusters of individuals who share similar molecular pathways for their disease and so could be treated in a targeted and personalised way. By evaluating the molecular and clinical data using the latest technology, the project will deliver new biomarkers for use in more targeted clinical trials. Clinicians can then tailor therapies according to the specific molecular pathways found in individual cases. In short, treatments will become more personalised.Towards targeted treatmentsA personalised approach to the treatment of autoimmune diseases would allow patients to receive an earlier and more accurate diagnosis. Since the new data will reveal the molecular mechanisms specific different groups of diseases, a tailored approach to clinical therapy can be identified and the precise molecular pathway can then be targeted. What’s more, earlier detection and more effective treatments will mean that the damaging effects of a late diagnosis can be avoided, and the patient’s disease progression can be better controlled. Sharing data to move forwardPRECISESADS brings together industry experience with academic and clinical expertise in the fields of genetics, metabolomics, mass spectrometry, rheumatology, and autoimmunology. The project will provide an advantage for the European pharmaceutical industry through the unique possibility of sharing new and existing data and findings on an unprecedented scale for these diseases. The expertise of the pharmaceutical industry is essential, as they have important knowledge of prior failures in this disease area and understand the urgent need to overcome the problem of the inappropriate classification of patients.By pooling existing data and using cutting-edge technologies, the project will help to pave the way for more effective and earlier treatment of these debilitating and dangerous autoimmune diseases. The research being undertaken has always been seen as necessary but sufficient funding and a collaborative model has only now become possible through IMI. This is a unique research project will directly benefit from advances in technology and will ultimately deliver results at the patient’s bedside. ",,,,,,Agencia Estatal Consejo Superior De Investigaciones Cientificas:846 180:Atrys Health SA:243 425:Centro Hospitalar do Porto – Hospital Santo António:153 324:Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin:378 985:Consorci Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer:145 320:Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum Berlin (left the project):49 453:Fondazione Irccs Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico:388 612:Fundacion Publica Andaluza Progreso Y Salud:1 826 852:Fundació Institut d'Investigació Biomèdica de Bellvitge:1 026 782:Karolinska Institutet:434 450:Katholieke Universiteit Leuven:229 400:Klinikum Der Universitaet Zu Koeln:129 800:Medizinische Hochschule Hannover:217 924:Medizinische Universitaet Wien:45 520:Quartz Bio S.A.:893 562:Servicio Andaluz De Salud:556 740:Servicio Cántabro de Salud:127 950:The Cyprus Foundation for Muscular Dystrophy Research:252 540:Universidad De Granada:480 780:Universita Degli Studi Di Milano:254 040:Universite Catholique De Louvain:341 995:Universite De Bretagne Occidentale:534 715:Universite De Geneve:270 140:University of Szeged:67 350:Centre Hospitalier de Recherche Universitaire:103 484:Total Cost:9 999 323,http://www.precisesads.eu,Yes,"IMI: Ann Martin

This is partly because the models which scientists use to predict the success of future drugs in the laboratory have been too simple when compared to the real tumours. IMI's PREDECT project has developed new laboratory models that more accurately mimic the three-dimensional complexity of tumours, and their behaviour within the microenvironment of the patient’s body. These models could help researchers discover more effective treatments in the future, thereby boosting survival rates.Laboratory tests are insufficiently predictive of cancer drugs’ activity in humans. The rate of failure to take novel drugs from the laboratory to humans, and then to registration for clinical use, has been very high. According to some estimates, between 90 and 95 per cent of drugs that went into clinical trials had no to only marginal effect on patients’ tumours. One of the reasons for that is that cancer is a very complex disease, both genetically and in terms of the tumour's interaction with the body. The models which scientists have been using in the laboratory to predict the success of a cancer drug in patients do not capture that complexity. IMI’s PREDECT project set out to change that.By bringing together top researchers from nine pharmaceutical companies, eight academic institutions and three SMEs, the project developed and characterised new laboratory models which should better capture the complexity of the disease and so predict drug efficacy more reliably. This could eventually lead to a lower failure rate in the development of new cancer drugs for the benefit of patients.Models that capture tumour architectureThe most common way of investigating tumours in the laboratory is by growing cancer cells on plastic dishes. However, this method captures neither the three-dimensional architecture of tumours, nor their heterogeneity, nor the interactions between cells and their surroundings.In order to better capture the three-dimensional nature of cancers, PREDECT project scientists further developed and reciprocally compared an array of spheroid models of tumour cells, as well as models generated from freshly collected tumour tissue. As an extension of this effort, the project initiated a biennial conference called ‘Goodbye Flat Biology’, under the auspices of the European Association of Cancer Research (EACR), to promote a continued dissemination of the concept that architectural aspects of cancer are very important in building good models.Reducing use of animals in researchOther important tumour aspects are that they are genetically diverse and that they are in constant interaction with their host. In order to capture that heterogeneity within the native microenvironment of the tumour, PREDECT project scientists developed a method to obtain very thin slices of tumours. These slices capture the complexity that is so essential for validating that a particular drug is going to work in the future.The tumour slicing method developed by the project significantly reduces the use of animals and required research time. Whereas in the past 18 animals had to be used to obtain 18 tumour samples, now 18 to 20 slices can be obtained from a single tumour. For this work, PREDECT scientists won one of AstraZeneca’s awards for the use of tumour slices as an innovative in vitro platform to reduce animal use.‘Game-changer’ in breast cancer researchThe project also developed a much-improved animal model to study oestrogen-receptor positive breast cancer, one of the most commonly diagnosed breast cancers. Experts wrote that this model was a ‘game-changer’, with the potential to lead to new treatments. The academic partners who developed this model now organise a course on this technique to enable other researchers to use it.Transfer of technology and other accomplishmentsIn addition to the successes mentioned above, other top project outputs include:a collection of open access papers, four of which include detailed protocols on the making of new laboratory models developed within the project;a collection of more than 30 000 images generated from a series of 16 oncology marker stainings done on all models created within the project - there are plans to make these available to the research community in the future;transfer of important technology, from SMEs and academia to pharma companies, which could increase the industry’s success in the development of future drugs.For the benefit of industry, academia, SMEsThe academic community is benefiting from gaining a deeper understanding of challenges in the development of complex cancer models, and from the new models which were created within the project. Thanks to this project, they also gained a better understanding of the thinking, constraints and needs of the industry.Industry, academia and SMEs are benefitting from the transfer of technology which occurred within the project. For example, a Portuguese SME transferred their bioreactor technology to pharma companies. Thanks to this, pharma companies changed the way they work, and the SME expanded its business and gained important new customers.The pharmaceutical industry is also benefitting from other technologies and models developed within the project, including tumour slices, as well as a range of 3D and animal models.All project participants are also benefitting from the collaborative network which was established as part of the project.What's next?Although this project achieved significant breakthroughs, there are still many questions left unanswered. The knowledge and insights gained during the project have solidified new collaborations, and may also lead to new projects in the future.Read the interview with the project coordinators","Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, Leverkusen, Germany:Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Basingstoke, United Kingdom:Institut De Recherches Internationales Servier, Suresnes, France:Sanofi-Aventis Recherche & Developpement, Chilly Mazarin, France:UCB Biopharma SPRL, Brussels, Belgium","Agencia Estatal Consejo Superior De Investigaciones Cientificas, Madrid, Spain:Atrys Health SA, Madrid, Spain:Centro Hospitalar do Porto – Hospital Santo António, Porto, Portugal:Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany:Consorci Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain:Fondazione Irccs Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy:Fundacion Publica Andaluza Progreso Y Salud, Seville , Spain:Fundació Institut d'Investigació Biomèdica de Bellvitge, Hospitalet De Llobregat, Spain:Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden:Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium:Klinikum Der Universitaet Zu Koeln, Cologne, Germany:Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany:Medizinische Universitaet Wien, Vienna, Austria:Servicio Andaluz De Salud, Sevilla, Spain:Servicio Cántabro de Salud, Santander, Spain:The Cyprus Foundation for Muscular Dystrophy Research, Nicosia, Cyprus:Universidad De Granada, Granada, Spain:Universita Degli Studi Di Milano, Milano, Italy:Universite Catholique De Louvain, Louvain-La-Neuve, Belgium:Universite De Bretagne Occidentale, Brest, France:Universite De Geneve, Genève 4, Switzerland:University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary","Quartz Bio S.A., Plan-les-Ouates, Switzerland","Centre Hospitalier de Recherche Universitaire, Brest, France",,Biomedicum Genomics Ltd:388 920:Cardiff University:20 764:Charles River Discovery Research Services Germany GMBH:812 984:Ecole Polytechnique Federale De Lausanne:649 980:Erasmus Universitair Medisch Centrum Rotterdam:1 082 944:Instituto de Biologia Experimental e Tecnológica:197 660:Robert Bosch Gesellschaft Fur Medizinische Forschung Mbh:339 864:Stichting Katholieke Universiteit:309 613:Tartu Ulikool:399 336:Teknologian Tutkimuskeskus VTT (left the project):495 294:University of Helsinki:3 284 288:Weizmann Institute Of Science:774 994:Total Cost:8 756 641,http://www.predect.eu,Yes,"IMI: Fatiha Sadallah

The treatment usually involves a combination of antibiotics, which poses a problem for companies that are used to developing one drug a time. Additionally, the current laboratory models used to predict the potential of new drug candidates have not been reliable, leading to a high failure rate in clinical trials. PreDiCT-TB project scientists developed a series of tools, which drug developers can use to increase the probability of them choosing the right drug-like compounds and getting them through clinical trials successfully. With that, the project laid the foundations for faster and better development of new TB medicines for the benefit of patients.Tuberculosis (TB) is the single biggest killer among infectious diseases, particularly in developing countries. It infects over 10 million people worldwide every year and kills 1.7 million. Treatment takes at least six months, it usually involves a combination of 4-7 drugs, and many patients struggle to take their antibiotics properly, fuelling the rise of drug-resistant strains of the disease. Despite all this, few new drugs for TB have been developed and registered since the 1970s.By bringing together academic researchers with expertise in the biology, immunology and imaging of the disease, as well as industry scientists specialising in drug development, IMI’s PreDiCT-TB project set out to speed up the search for new, more effective combinations of treatments to tackle this deadly disease. In particular, the project aimed to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of preclinical laboratory models in predicting the success of drug candidates in clinical trials, which has been a major bottleneck in TB drug development.Comparison of preclinical and clinical dataIn order to achieve that, the project created a large database of preclinical data with many different preclinical models, from simple experiments in broth through to animal models – the largest and most diverse preclinical dataset available in TB to date. The project team also undertook a comprehensive review of published data from clinical trials, and created a large database containing 31 clinical trials with more than 15 000 participants.Furthermore, PreDiCT-TB scientists performed the first systematic quantitative comparisons of preclinical and clinical results in order to evaluate how effective different preclinical models are in predicting the success of drug candidates in clinical trials. The researchers took a mathematical modelling approach to integrating that information, putting it together in a way that can be used by drug developers to predict what will happen in clinical trials. Altogether, the project produced a series of tools, which drug developers can use to increase the probability of them choosing the right drug-like compounds and getting them through clinical trials successfully.New biomarkers for diagnosing TBThe project also developed new biomarkers, which enable scientists to understand how the TB drug candidates work in preclinical and clinical trials. Currently scientists measure the effect of potential new treatments either by culturing TB bacteria from a patient-derived specimen, or by using DNA-based diagnostic tests. Growing a culture is very slow, taking up to three months before a result is available. DNA tests on the other hand are fast, but they remain positive even after the bacteria is dead, making them unsuitable for tracking the effectiveness of potential new treatments.A new method fine-tuned by the PreDiCT-TB project is based on measuring ribosomal RNA. The RNA is easy to detect even when there are very few organisms present, and unlike the DNA, it does not survive long after antibiotics kill the bug. The method, called the mycobacterial load assay (MBLA), offers a much faster way to diagnose tuberculosis and has the potential to improve both the speed and effectiveness of preclinical and clinical TB trials.Reducing the use of animals in researchPreDiCT-TB scientists have also done a lot of work to improve the design of preclinical studies and decrease the number of animals used when possible. Additionally, the project evaluated the effectiveness of different animal species in predicting the success of potential TB treatments. In some cases, this resulted in moving to the use of lower phylogenetic species such as zebrafish.For example, one of the SMEs in the project developed a zebrafish high-throughput screening model. The model enables them to screen very large numbers of TB drugs, and combinations of drugs, very efficiently. The tool may become very valuable in early phases of clinical development.For the benefit of industry, academia and SMEsThe industry benefited from the new resources and tools developed within the project, which they could not have developed on their own. They also benefited from the network of TB scientists, which will continue to exist beyond the lifetime of the project.The academic community likewise benefitted from contacts with the pharmaceutical industry and SMEs, as well as from access to industry data and compounds. Thanks to this project, they learned a great deal about the drug development process and gained an understanding of how their models and skills could be used to enable better and faster drug development.The SMEs in the project also benefitted from the network and resources within the project. Furthermore, contacts with the pharmaceutical industry enabled them to learn about the needs of their customers and gave them the necessary support and insights to develop and optimise important preclinical tools, such as the zebrafish high-throughput screening model.What’s nextAll of the key resources generated by the project are, or soon will be, publicly available. The databases of preclinical data and clinical data – both of which are a key resource for the wider TB drug development community – have permanent homes that will be funded for at least the next decade.Some of the technologies developed within the project, such as the MBLA, have been made available to any external scientific group at a cost. Finally, a lot of the code base for many of the modelling and simulation tools that have been developed will be soon available through publicly accessible websites.Read the interview with project coordinators","Abbvie Inc, North Chicago, Illinois, United States :Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Bayer Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany:Boehringer Ingelheim Internationalgmbh, Ingelheim, Germany:Charles River Discovery Research Services Germany GMBH, Freiburg, Germany:F.

PRO-active,,,Chiesi,Closed,01/09/2009,31/05/2016,IMI1,1,Group Chronic diseases,Physical Activity as a Crucial Patient Reported Outcome in COPD ,Respiratory diseases:Tools for predicting/monitoring safety,RIA (Research and Innovation Action),115011,6 767 597,7 230 350,,1 637 875,"Although lack of physical activity is one of the most common predictors of mortality in patients with chronic obstructive respiratory disease, there are no validated tools to measure the impact of the disease on how patients experience physical activity. The PROactive project developed new, innovative patient reported outcome tools to capture both the experienced amount of physical activity and the difficulties during activity, opening the way for the development of more effective treatments. The project also developed innovative ways to enhance physical activity, both as it is objectively measured and as it is experienced by patients. Furthermore, the project succeeded in placing physical activity higher on the agenda of clinicians, patient organisations and researchers, and patients are already reaping the benefits.
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases, affecting 10% of people over the age of 50. The most common symptoms of COPD are breathlessness (shortness of breath), excessive sputum production, and a chronic cough. According to the World Health Organisation, 64 million people are affected worldwide and about 3 million died from the disease. Furthermore, WHO predicts it will become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2030.Patients with COPD often reduce their physical activity and their normal way of life because of unpleasant symptoms associated with the disease. Even though a lack of physical activity is one of the most common predictors of mortality, before PROactive there were no valid tests to measure the impact of the disease on physical activity levels and related dimensions (e.g. the symptoms experienced during physical activity). The commonly used lung function tests for COPD provide only limited information on the progression of the disease and the patients’ quality of life. Exercise tests, on the other hand are more an assessment of the capacity of the patient, rather than of the problems patients experience in their daily lives.An innovative tool which simplifies the lives of patientsBy following guidelines outlined by the regulatory authorities, the PROactive project developed innovative patient reported outcome (PRO) tools to measure patients’ experience of physical activity in terms of ‘amount’ of activity and ‘difficulty’. They did this in an innovative way by merging questions about patients’ experience of physical activity with information obtained through wearable physical activity monitors. This is not only an innovation but also a simplification in the PRO field which makes the life of patients easier: they have to answer only a few relevant questions and the rest is recorded via activity monitors sensitive enough to capture the activity of COPD patients. Moreover, the questionnaires were developed by patients and are therefore written in the language of patients, making them easy to use and understand.In order to ensure the robustness of the new PRO tools, the consortium tested them in a heterogeneous group of more than 1000 patients in five EU languages. All the data gathered has been submitted to the European Medicines Agency for the qualification procedure of novel drug development methodologies. If accepted by the regulators, these new PRO tools would enable pharmaceutical companies and others to use them in clinical trials to assess the effectiveness of new treatments on physical activity. Such therapies could be drugs, but also non-pharmacological interventions such as rehabilitation.In the meantime, the tool is already being used for research purposes by partners in the project, and at least one company outside of the consortium. Furthermore, more than 50 culturally sensitive translations are already available for use in global research.Putting physical activity higher on the agendaWhile the development of the PRO tools is the most significant project achievement, the project also contributed to the field in other ways.It helped clarify the role that physical inactivity plays in COPD and put it higher on the agenda of patient organisations, researchers and clinicians. Patients are already experiencing benefits, as clinicians are increasingly recognising that tackling physical inactivity should be one of the key targets in the management of this disease.While some activity monitors are valid tools to get insight in the amount of physical activity patients engage in, this project has shown that they are not enough to capture the physical activity experience of patients suffering from COPD. They need to be combined with questions providing further insight into how patients experience physical activity.The project developed a methodology for evaluating activity monitors to identify those sensitive enough to measure physical activity in patients with a chronic disease such as COPD. Three such monitors were identified and two of these extensively used. Furthermore, the project developed the know-how on processing, standardising and analysing data from activity monitors, so this data can be successfully used in clinical trials.It developed several new, innovative interventions for COPD patients, such as a tele-coaching method to boost patients’ activity levels. A short term multi-centre study showed that this tele-coaching intervention significantly increases the level of physical activity in COPD patients, opening up pathways for further research.For the benefit of industry, academia and patientsPROactive’s new tools will provide drug companies with new ways of assessing the clinical benefits of novel treatments on the physical activity in COPD patients. The tools will also benefit patients by helping them evaluate the improvements or deterioration in their physical activity experience, including the effect of new treatments on this important aspect of their lives. Finally, participation in PROactive enabled academic researchers to master scientific rigour needed to develop such PRO tools, raising their profile in the field and helping them build a valuable network for future research.What happens next?Even though the project has officially ended, the project participants signed a memorandum of understanding to stay together and continue to develop their tools. The idea is to oversee future uses of the tools, such as translations to other languages and the development of the tools in other chronic disease areas. Read the interview with the project coordinators","Boehringer Ingelheim Internationalgmbh, Ingelheim, Germany:Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Basingstoke, United Kingdom:F.

The objective is to provide tools to the drug developers to reliably demonstrate the modulation of key pathologic processes in tumours in patients in realistic trials. Looking further into the future, therapies for, and biomarkers of, the processes of invasion and metastasis will be of increasing importance, because in most cases it is metastasis, not the primary tumour, which kills the patient.
Currently available IBs illuminate only a small proportion of the tumour pathologies so there is a pressing need to develop measures of proliferation, apoptosis and necrosis into biomarkers which can reliably support both positive and negative decisions.Through a portfolio of highly innovative approaches to devise, evaluate and introduce IBs of invasion and metastasis, the QuIC-ConCePT vision for January 2016 is that drug developers can incorporate these IBs for decision-making in Phase I trials of investigational therapies that can be readily deployed in multiple cancer centres in a robust, consistent, ethical, and cost-effective way acceptable to patients. The results of the QuIC-ConCePT work should have utility in cancer research and in patient management in a very wide range of other important settings.The managing entity European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) is already a world leader in the qualification of IBs and the consortium includes some of the world's most productive and innovative physicians and scientists in cancer imaging. The QuIC-ConCePT project will work in close collaboration with the newly approved FP7 project EuroBioImaging “Research infrastructure for imaging technologies in biological and biomedical sciences” coordinated by EIBIR and EMBL.

RAPP-ID,,,Janssen,Closed,01/04/2011,30/09/2016,IMI1,2,Group Antibiotic resistance,Development of rapid point-of-care test platforms for infectious diseases ,Infectious diseases:Diagnostics,RIA (Research and Innovation Action),115153,6 828 438,6 379 048,,2 719 814,"Doctors treating infectious diseases still don’t have rapid diagnostic tests which could help them identify the exact strains of pathogens ailing their patients. The development of such tests is complex and expensive, but that may improve thanks to IMI’s RAPP-ID project, which developed some of the technologies and innovations needed to speed up the development of such tests in the future. For example, the project developed a prototype of a breath sampler for influenza – the first test which uses something as simple as breathing out to detect the presence of pathogens in patients. Some of the technologies created under RAPP-ID are undergoing further development in new EU-funded projects.An important unmet needExcellent care for people with suspected infections involves rapid diagnosis and treatment. For instance, administering the correct antibiotic as soon as possible to patients with blood infections dramatically improves their chances of survival. On the other hand, using antibiotics when they do not benefit patients exposes them unnecessarily to side effects and potential antibiotic resistance. Despite all the advances in medicine, we still do not have the technology available that can quickly diagnose what kind of infection a patient has and what treatment they need. Even the best of the currently available diagnostic methods are too slow to help clinicians.The RAPP-ID project aimed to provide an integrated solution that addresses the technological challenges to enhance clinical decision-making and improve the quality of care and clinical outcomes for patients. More specifically, it aimed to develop rapid point-of-care platforms (POCTs) for the rapid detection of bacteria, tuberculosis bacteria, fungi, and viruses as well as patients’ markers of infection (less than 2 hours in hospitals, and less than 30 min in primary care).Good outcomes in spite of challengesDeveloping diagnostic tests for infectious diseases is very challenging, and due to limited time and resources, the project fell short of developing fully-fledged rapid diagnostic tests. However, some of the innovations and technologies developed within the project could speed up the development of such tests in the future. Furthermore, the project produced other resources and tools which could be useful for the future development of POCTs.Defining user requirementsMany tests have been produced in the past that are miracles of bioengineering but have not provided clinicians with what they require for optimal care. In order to understand the requirements for these tests, the RAPP-ID team put a lot of effort into drawing up user specifications which outline what diagnostic tests for different infectious diseases should even look like. These guidelines could help anyone working on diagnostic tests for infectious diseases in the future.Prototype of the breath samplerAfter the user specifications were defined, the project team set out to develop some of the technologies needed to create rapid diagnostic tests. Perhaps the biggest and most innovative achievement of the project was the development of a prototype breath sampler for influenza. Patients exhale into the instrument, which captures tiny particles in their breath, and then uses that sample to detect the presence of pathogens. During the project, the team was able to demonstrate that the instrument is able to capture airborne pathogens, and started testing it on patients in the clinic. However, the technology is still in the relatively early stages of development, and would need more time and resources to be developed into a clinically validated test. This innovation is now part of IMI2 – Call 11 on the sustainability of IMI project results and might be developed further by one of the winning consortia.Chips for diagnosing pneumoniaAnother important project achievement was the prototype of the ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) test. VAP is a very serious infection in people who are in intensive care. The illness has a very high death rate and diagnostic tests that could detect these bacteria quickly are urgently needed. The RAPP-ID project developed chips which help isolate the DNA of these bacteria from aspirates of VAP patients. As the amount of DNA which can be extracted from these bacteria is very low, the DNA from these samples had to be amplified before detection. The chip was aimed to run on an instrument making it a complete diagnostic test. Although nearly there, this device-chip combination would require a further software update to run autonomously – a process which could not be fully completed within the scope of the RAPP-ID project.Other achievementsIn addition to the innovations mentioned above, the project developed many other resources and innovations which are now available for future research, including a technology for the acoustic manipulation of bacteria with the help of beads, and cell lines for various bacterial strains.For the benefit of industry and academiaThe academic community benefited from the project in several ways. First of all, they made big progress in developing some of their ideas for rapid diagnostic tests. Secondly, by interacting with other academic partners and industry, they were able to expand those ideas and add certain components to their technology platforms which they could not have developed on their own. The project also resulted in about 30 scientific publications, with more to come.Thanks to RAPP-ID, both the pharmaceutical industry and academic partners learned about the challenges involved in developing diagnostic tests and bringing them to the market. As the first IMI project of this kind, RAPP-ID was in many ways a learning experience for everyone involved and could help enhance collaboration between the medicine and diagnostic worlds, shaping better EU-funded diagnostic projects in the future.All of the partners in the project, including academia, industry and SMEs, also benefitted from the collaboration and new partnerships formed within the project. Some of these collaborations are continuing and have resulted in new spin out projects.Future stepsThe findings of the RAPP-ID project inspired at least two spin out projects funded by the EU. The first focused on urinary tract infections (UTIs) and developed a chip which can detect drug-resistant, UTI-causing bacteria. The chip is similar to the one developed in RAPP-ID for VAP.The second spin out project, New diagnostics for infectious diseases (ND4ID), is a Marie Sk_odowska -Curie project which will enable 15 PhD students to conduct their research at industry and academic laboratories across Europe. It will run until early 2020 and involves many of the RAPP-ID project partners.Read the interview with project coordinators","Biogen Idec Limited, Maidenhead, Berkshire, United Kingdom:H.

More than 800 scientists have already been trained through this new programme, which has the potential to speed up biopharmaceutical innovation and may eventually lead to a cost reduction in drug development.Drug safety is an extremely important part of the drug development process. Yet, prior to the launch of IMI’s SafeSciMET project in 2010, educational and training programmes in drug safety science in Europe were scarce. IMI’s SafeSciMET project addressed this gap successfully.By bringing together 16 academic institutions and 14 pharmaceutical companies, the project developed a curriculum of 20 courses which cover topics along the whole trajectory of drug safety sciences, from developing a drug candidate, through testing it in laboratory studies, and all the way to bringing it to the patient. Professionals can follow single courses in safety sciences or selected subsets of courses, and be accredited for continuing professional development. Furthermore, students successfully completing the full training programme, including a master’s thesis, get awarded with an accredited master’s degree from the University of Konstanz in Germany, one of the project partners.The SafeSciMET courses are open to scientists from industry, academia and regulatory agencies, and encompass the safety, ethical, regulatory and societal aspects of drug discovery and development. About 800 students have been trained so far: about 40% of them came from the pharmaceutical industry, 35% from academia and 10% from regulatory offices.Courses adapted to real-life industry needsEach course has a course leader from industry and academia, and in addition to the theoretical knowledge, contains real-life case studies from industry partners. Thanks to this public-private collaboration, the project created a unique pan-European training network of more than 200 course leaders and teachers from both industry and academia.SafeSciMET training is already leading to a new generation of safety specialists with strong competences in the application of novel technologies in risk assessment. The hope is that thanks to this unique programme, they will be able to perform reliable evaluations of the safety of drug candidates and new medicines in a more effective way. This could in turn speed up biopharmaceutical innovation and may eventually lead to a cost reduction in drug development.For the benefit of industry and academiaThanks to the SafeSciMET programme, the pharmaceutical industry got access to a new breed of trained professionals who are better positioned to address challenges in drug development and safety.The academic partners benefited from the pharmaceutical companies’ expertise in drug safety sciences, which helped them design courses that are more in tune with the real-life needs of the industry. As a result, students trained through this programme have been getting easier access to jobs in the industry.Both industry and academic project partners are also benefiting from the pan-European network of safety science educators and experts which was established through this project.What’s next?During the course of the project, three course cycles were held. After the end of the project, the project partners managed to set up a short-term sustainability plan thanks to which a fourth course will run in 2017 and 2018. This and future course cycles are coordinated and managed by the University of Konstanz. Read the interview with project coordinators","Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Corp, Princeton, NJ, United States :Glaxosmithkline Research And Development LTD., Brentford, Middlesex, United Kingdom:Janssen Pharmaceutica Nv, Beerse, Belgium:Pfizer Limited, Sandwich, Kent , United Kingdom:Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GMBH, Frankfurt / Main, Germany:UCB Biopharma SPRL, Brussels, Belgium","Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden, Leiden, Netherlands:Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum Berlin, Berlin, Germany:Fondazione Per L'Istituto Di Ricerc A In Biomedicina, Bellinzona, Switzerland:Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden:King'S College London, London, United Kingdom:Medizinische Universitaet Wien, Vienna, Austria:Semmelweis Egyetem, Budapest, Hungary:The University Of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom:The University Of Queensland, St Lucia, Australia:Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany:University Of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom:University Of Newcastle Upon Tyne, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom","Anocca AB, Karlskrona, Sweden:Apitope International Nv, Diepenbeek, Belgium",,,"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin:18 315:European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences:231 400:Hospices Civils de Lyon (Lyon General Hospitals):26 027:Karolinska Institutet:21 400:Kobenhavns Universitet:52 200:Martin-Luther-Universitaet Halle-Wittenberg:21 800:Stichting Lygature:20 727:Stichting Vu:767 305:The University Of Liverpool:27 225:Universitat Konstanz:531 300:Universitat Wien:34 800:Universite De Lorraine:1 665:Universiteit Leiden:64 300:University of Lisboa, Faculty of Pharmacy (Faculdade de Farmácia da Universidade de Lisboa):20 727:University Of Surrey:47 867:Université Paris-Sud:2 340:Uppsala Universitet:485 506:Total Cost:2 374 904",https://ssm.afww.uni-konstanz.de,No,"IMI: Hugh Laverty

The scientists of the SAFE-T project developed improved tools for prediction, detection, and monitoring of drug-induced injuries to the kidney, liver, and vascular system, using markers in patients’ blood and/or urine. Application of SAFE-T biomarkers will make drugs safer, reduce the number of drugs that have to be abandoned in late stages of development, and improve diagnosis and management of acute and chronic diseases relevant to public health not only in Europe, but globally.
Adverse drug reactions: significant cost to societyIt is estimated that 197 000 deaths per year in the EU are caused by adverse drug reactions and that the total cost to society in the EU is €79 million. Among the side effects most challenging to drug developers and prescribers alike are drug-induced injuries to the kidney, liver and vascular system. By bringing together pharmaceutical companies, academic centres, and SMEs, SAFE-T has made a significant contribution to detecting such adverse reactions as early and accurately as possible during drug development, through the extensive characterisation of new markers in patients’ blood and/or urine (biomarkers). As well as having great potential to improve drug safety, these biomarkers could in the future also be applied to non-drug related diseases of the liver, kidney, and vascular system.Letters of support from regulatory agenciesThe project generated a vast amount of data on 105 initial biomarker candidates, of which more than 20 showed promising performance. The data on some of these biomarkers has been submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the agencies recently issued letters of support. The letters of support indicate that the new biomarkers have the potential for use in drug development, and that additional exploration and data generation is warranted. As such, the letters are designed to encourage scientists to collect additional data from nonclinical and exploratory clinical trials. Other achievements: biobank and databaseWhile the characterisation of the biomarkers is the most significant project achievement, SAFE-T also contributed to the field in other ways:The team defined and published a scientific strategy for the qualification of biomarkers, which will help improve the efficacy of future qualification efforts.The project created a biobank with serum, plasma and urine samples from more than 11 000 patients across 19 different populations. The biobank can now be used by other researchers for the qualification of additional safety biomarker candidates.The project set up a database with comprehensive data on 105 new biomarkers. The database will support further research on drug-induced kidney, liver and vascular injuries.Read the interview with the project's coordinators","Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Bayer Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany:Boehringer Ingelheim Internationalgmbh, Ingelheim, Germany:Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Basingstoke, United Kingdom:F.

But what is frailty, and can it be prevented? The ultimate aim of the IMI project SPRINTT is to improve elderly people’s quality of life by paving the way towards a treatment for frailty. The project will do this by identifying the specific characteristics of frailty and testing whether frailty can be prevented by a treatment programme that combines exercise, dietary advice, and the use of modern technologies.
Europe’s population is ageing fast, with the number of over 65s set to rise from over 85 million in 2008 to 151 million in 2060. Many of these people will become frail as they age; a common feature of frailty is a loss of muscle mass and strength (known as sarcopenia), and this makes those affected more vulnerable to falls and places them at greater risk of becoming disabled. The frail are also more likely to be hospitalised or to require long-term care in a nursing home. Frailty therefore has a huge impact on older people's quality of life and represents a significant burden for health and social care systems. Frailty is not uncommon – the SHARE (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe) study revealed that 17% of the over 65s in Europe are frail while 42% are ‘pre-frail’. Yet despite its prevalence and its impact on both quality of life and healthcare systems, there is no formal, widely-accepted definition of frailty and no treatment to prevent its onset and progression.The SPRINTT project brings together major pharmaceutical companies, leading universities and hospitals, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with the overall goal of improving  frailty care and prevention in Europe.The first goal of the project is to define the specific characteristics of frailty that can be easily applied in healthcare settings. This will make possible to precisely identify people affected by frailty. At the core of SPRINTT project is  a large clinical trial to assess treatment options designed to prevent the frail from becoming disabled and losing their mobility. The trial, which will involve around 1 500 patients from across Europe, will randomly allocate participants to one of two groups. The first group will receive a multi-component intervention including physical activity and nutritional advice and supplements as well as innovative technologies. Among other things, these innovative technologies will support efforts to coach participants on physical activity and diet, and help to monitor participants’ health and frailty (for example by logging falls or near-falls). The other group will take part in a general health education programme. All participants will be followed up for two years.The project team will also work closely with medicines regulators to ensure its findings can be rapidly implemented in clinical practice and applied to improve the development of innovative drugs for frailty.Ultimately, the outcomes of the SPRINTT project should result in improved treatment options and a better quality of life for the frail. This will also benefit health and social care systems. More broadly, SPRINTT’s output will demonstrate how health research and healthcare systems can be adapted to the needs of older people with long-term health problems.Pharmaceutical industries and SMEs will also benefit from the project that will establish sound methodologies for developing innovative treatments for frailty and sarcopenia.","Amgen, Brussels, Belgium:Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Bayer Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany:Boehringer Ingelheim Internationalgmbh, Ingelheim, Germany:Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Basingstoke, United Kingdom:F.

The cell lines will help to improve and speed up the drug development process, and ensure that patients benefit from more effective and safer drugs.
Currently, many drugs fail rather late in the drug development process because the tests used in the earlier stages of drug development simply do not reflect what happens in real life when the drug is administered in patients. This is partly because these early tests rely heavily on animal cells, and when human cells are used, they have often been extensively modified to survive in culture and so no longer behave naturally. Those working in drug research and development therefore urgently need a good supply of cells that more accurately mimic what happens in the human body.The power of pluripotencyMost adult cells can only divide to produce other cells of the same type – for example, skin cells can only make other skin cells, and blood cells can only make other blood cells. Only embryonic stem cells are ‘pluripotent’, i.e. able to give rise to all the different kinds of cell that make up the human body. However, in recent years researchers have developed a way of reprogramming ordinary adult cells to create so-called induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Like embryonic stem cells, iPS cells are able to generate any kind of cell; as such, they offer researchers a good supply of different kinds of human cell that can be used in research and drug development. The research resulting in the creation of the first iPS cells was a major scientific breakthrough that won scientists John Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka the 2012 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.A unique resourceSTEMBANCC’s goal is to generate 1 500 iPS cell lines from 500 people, characterise them in terms of their genetic, protein, and metabolic profiles, and make them available to researchers. All cell lines will also undergo a rigorous quality check. The raw materials for the project will be largely skin and blood samples taken from patients with certain diseases, people who display adverse reactions to drugs, and healthy individuals. The collection of these samples will be carried out with the individuals’ informed consent and in line with strict ethical standards. There will be a strong focus on peripheral nervous system disorders (especially pain); central nervous system disorders (e.g. dementias); neurodysfunctional diseases (e.g. migraine, autism, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder); and diabetes. The project will also investigate the use of human iPS cells for toxicology testing; here the team will use the iPS cells to generate liver, heart, nerve and kidney cells. Ultimately STEMBANCC will be a source of well-characterised, patient-derived iPS cells that will help researchers study diseases, develop new treatments, and test the efficacy and safety of new drugs.","Glaxosmithkline Research And Development LTD., Brentford, Middlesex, United Kingdom:Institut De Recherches Internationales Servier, Suresnes, France:Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland:Sanofi-Aventis Recherche & Developpement, Chilly Mazarin, France","Aston University, Birmingham, United Kingdom:Centre Hospitalier Universitaire De Toulouse, Toulouse Cedex 09, France:Diabetes Frail Ltd, Droitwich, United Kingdom:Friedrich-Alexander University (FAU) Erlangen-Nürnberg, Erlangen, Germany:Istituto Nazionale Di Riposo E Cura Per Anziani Inrca, Ancona, Italy:Medizinische Universitat Graz, Graz, Austria:Servicio Madrileno De Salud, Madrid, Spain:Universita Cattolica Del Sacro Cuore, Milan, Italy:Universita Degli Studi Di Firenze, Florence, Italy:Universitaetsmedizin Goettingen - Georg-August-Universitaet Goettingen - Stiftung Oeffentlichen Rechts, Goettingen, Germany:Universite Paris Descartes, Paris , France:Universiteit Maastricht, Maastricht, Netherlands:University of Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland:University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland:Università degli Studi di Parma, Parma, Italy:Univerzita Karlova, Prague 1, Czech Republic:Uniwersytet Jagiello_ski, Krakow, Poland","Caretek s.r.l., Torino, Italy:EU-Open S.R.L., veronella (Vr), Italy:Roessingh Research and Development BV, Enschede, Netherlands","Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de LIMOGES, Limoges, France:Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale, Paris, France",,Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin:383 476:Concentris Research Management GmbH:623 147:Helmholtz Zentrum Muenchen Deutsches Forschungszentrum Fuer Gesundheit Und Umwelt GMBH:758 325:Institut National De L'Environnement Industriel Et Des Risques:132 600:Institut National De La Sante Et De La Recherche Medicale:1 006 625:King'S College London:1 080 474:Linkopings Universitet:460 172:Medical Research Council (left the project):32 111:Medizinische Hochschule Hannover:819 681:Medizinische Universitat Innsbruck:383 476:Naturwissenschaftliches Und Medizinisches Institut An Der Universitaet Tuebingen:881 996:Newcells Biotech Limited:140 987:Region Hovedstaden:167 771:Tel Aviv University:431 411:The Hebrew University of Jerusalem:431 411:The University Of Birmingham:175 284:The University Of Edinburgh:1 921 723:Univercell Biosolutions SAS:783 535:Universite De Geneve:575 214:Universite De Lausanne:383 476:Universite De Technologie De Compiegne:250 877:University College London:1 462 000:University of Cambridge:958 690:University of Luebeck:63 337:University Of Newcastle Upon Tyne:1 886 399:University of Oxford:9 099 682:Universitätsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein:706 120:Total Cost:26 000 000,https://stembancc.org/,Yes,"IMI: Fatiha Sadallah

SUMMIT developed new biomarkers, imaging techniques and animal models which will make future preclinical and clinical trials more reliable and efficient, speeding up the development of new drugs. The project also raised the profile of European researchers, enabling them to become globally recognised as leaders in the field. Finally, the project resulted in several patent applications and the creation of a start-up, bringing concrete socio-economic benefits.
There are an estimated 420 million people worldwide suffering from diabetes, and that figure is set to rise to 700 million by 2025. Many diabetes patients develop devastating, chronic complications including coronary heart disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease, as well as eye and kidney problems. These complications impose an immense burden on the quality of life of the patients and account for more than ten percent of the health care costs in Europe.Currently there is a high therapeutic need for new treatments for diabetes complications beyond the existing diabetes treatments, which focus mostly on lowering blood glucose levels. Clinical trials to show the benefits of potential therapies are lengthy and costly. Therefore, the key objective of SUMMIT was to develop procedures, technologies and tools to make clinical trials to test novel medications for diabetes complications shorter and more focused.Clues in patients’ bloodNot all patients are at equal risk of developing diabetic complications. In order to better predict, monitor and treat the patients at risk, the scientists of the SUMMIT project searched for biological clues (biomarkers) in the patients’ blood and urine that indicate if a patient is likely to develop complications. As part of the analysis, researchers measured almost 2 000 biomarkers, and identified some important predictors for diabetes complications. For example, they discovered a panel of 14 biomarkers which can differentiate between patients who will rapidly develop end-stage renal (kidney) disease, which requires dialysis, and patients who are less likely to need dialysis in the near future. A patent has been filed for this panel of biomarkers, and could become a valuable tool for doctors and hospitals in evaluating their patients and predicting their future treatment needs.When it comes to the cardiovascular disease, the scientists also discovered a panel of six biomarkers which improve our ability to predict which patients will develop cardiovascular disease. They also found that an enzyme which softens the plaque that builds up in blood vessels is a risk factor in developing cardiovascular disease. If this enzyme is active it leads to plaque rupture, which in turn leads to a heart attack or a stroke.Looking for answers in the genesIn addition to the biomarkers, SUMMIT scientists performed large examinations of genetic variants in different individuals to see if any variants are associated with a higher risk of developing diabetes complications. These studies were performed on almost 11 000 patients for kidney disease, more than 24 000 patients for cardiovascular disease, nearly 10 000 patients for retinopathy (a common eye disorder in diabetes patients) and more than 17 000 patients for lower extremity arterial disease. The comprehensive analysis – the largest such effort undertaken to date – showed that there are no obvious genetic markers which predispose patients to developing diabetes complications. The huge collection of genetic data which was generated during this effort will be a valuable asset in further research.Of mice, rats and menIn order to improve preclinical trials, the SUMMIT team also performed a systematic review of 19 existing and newly generated animal models for diabetes complications. Such an effort had never been done before, and it helped clean up and clarify the situation in the field. A promising new rat model was developed, validated and a patent application for it has been filed.Imaging and a new tool for predicting heart attacks and strokesAs part of its effort to improve imaging techniques to monitor the progress of atherosclerosis (the build-up of plaques in the blood vessels), the project has also developed a new, non-invasive ultrasound device capable of identifying patients at imminent risk of a heart attack or stroke. Although the device was developed for diabetes patients, it is now being validated for a range of other diseases. A patent application is pending and a start-up company, Mediscienta, has been created to develop this innovation commercially.Other achievementsIn addition to the work on biomarkers, genetic markers, imaging and animal models, the project recorded a number of other achievements.Scientists in the project completed a multi-centre study of diabetic cardiovascular patients, and created a database and a biobank with one of the best characterised diabetic cardiovascular patient groups in the world. Both will be an asset in future research.With 1 320 study subjects, the project created the largest dataset of optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements in diabetes patents. OCT is a technique for obtaining images of the inside of the body at much higher resolution than other imaging modalities such as MRI or ultrasound. The project also developed a method to standardise OCT measurements in multi-centre trials and clinical practice.The project generated more than 100 scientific publications, with more publications still to come. It also resulted in 15 doctoral theses from different universities.For the benefit of industry, academia and patientsTools and techniques developed during this project, such as new biomarkers and imaging modalities, will improve the prediction of major diabetes complications in clinical trials. New animal models developed will make it easier to choose the right models for specific research questions in preclinical trials. All this will make drug development faster and more efficient, benefitting both the pharmaceutical industry and patients.The academic community also reaped many benefits, such as access to the resources, expertise and knowledge of the pharmaceutical industry. Additionally, the project has opened up many new funding opportunities and new avenues for future collaborations between industry and academia.Last but not least, SUMMIT raised the profile of the European research community globally; before SUMMIT, the diabetes research field was dominated by US consortia, but now Europe is increasingly seen as the leader in the field.What happens next?SUMMIT generated a lot of data and opened up many avenues for future research. Two new IMI projects, BEAT-DKD and RHAPSODY, will build on the legacy of SUMMIT to further advance research in the diabetes field in coming years.Read the interview with project coordinators","Abbvie Deutschland GMBH & Co Kg, Wiesbaden, Germany:Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Boehringer Ingelheim Internationalgmbh, Ingelheim, Germany:Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Basingstoke, United Kingdom:F.

In sharing the knowledge and data discovered, TRANSLOCATION will develop guidelines for designing and developing new drugs to tackle antibiotic resistance and create an information centre for pre-existing and on-going antibacterial research data which will be used to establish best practices for future antibacterial drug discovery efforts.
The AMR arms race – developing New Drugs for Bad Bugs
AMR represents a serious and growing threat to human and animal health worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), ‘antibiotic resistance is becoming a public health emergency of yet unknown proportions’. In the EU, AMR is responsible for some 25 000 deaths every year, and the annual treatment and social costs have been estimated at some €1.5 billion. Meanwhile, new forms of resistance continue to arise and spread, leaving clinicians with few weapons to bring infections under control. Yet despite the recognised need for new antibiotics, the reality is that only two new classes of antibiotics have been brought to the market in the last three decades.The reasons for this are manifold. On the scientific front, there is an urgent need for a greater understanding of how antibiotics work, how bacteria develop resistance to them, and what molecular mechanisms could be exploited to get round bacterial defence mechanisms. At the same time, today’s regulatory pathways mean clinical trials for antibiotics are extremely expensive. This, combined with the likelihood that the use of new antibiotics may be limited to situations where they are truly needed, leads to a low overall return on investment. Thus antibiotic discovery and development is simply no longer a financially viable option for businesses, and just a handful of pharmaceutical companies remain in the field.If no action is taken to address these issues, we risk leaving society in a situation where doctors will have few, if any, options to treat resistant bacterial infections. To avoid a public health emergency, the entire antibiotic research community, including researchers in universities, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and pharmaceutical companies must work together to reinvigorate research into new antibiotics. As a public-private partnership (PPP), IMI is the ideal platform to launch such an initiative.In its Action Plan against the rising threats from Antimicrobial Resistance of November 2011, the European Commission called for ‘unprecedented collaborate research and development efforts to bring new antibiotics to patients’ by, among other things, launching an IMI programme ‘for research on new antibiotics aimed at improving the efficiency of research and development of new antibiotics through unprecedented open sharing of knowledge’.The result is the New Drugs for Bad Bugs (ND4BB) programme, the first two topics of which were launched as IMI’s 6th Call for proposals in May 2012. TRANSLOCATION is the result of one of those topics. A third topic under ND4BB was launched as part of IMI’s 8th Call for proposals in December 2012.From single molecule translocation to rational drug design
The TRANSLOCATION project will focus on discovering important new information to improve the selection and optimisation of promising molecules which can be used for novel antibiotic drug discovery. The lack of progress in antibacterial drug discovery, especially against Gram-negative pathogens, is partly due to a lack of information about how potential drugs are able to get through the bacterial cell envelope and remain inside long enough to destroy it. Through this new research, TRANSLOCATION will generate knowledge which can be used in the development of new technologies for measuring the transport of molecules across the cell envelope into the bacteria, and for better understanding the mechanisms that bacteria use to flush out certain molecules before they can be effective. Experts will research the structures of porins, proteins which act as portals in the outer membrane of the bacteria for the transport of certain smaller molecules into and out of the bacteria.. Scientists from academia and industry will conduct a screening programme to identify key proteins which are important in understanding bacteria’s ability to reject certain molecules.Learning from success and failure
This second key aspect of the project’s scope, learning from success and failure, requires broad knowledge and skill sets and a large body of data from multiple sources. The creation of a cross-project ND4BB information centre and the development of the business model to support the sharing of data will offer the wider antibiotic research community the opportunity to have access to new data from the results of all projects under the IMI AMR programme. TRANSLOCATION’s information centre will be managed through its newly-developed model for data sharing. The project team will coordinate the disclosure and combined analysis of previously confidential information, which is being provided primarily from participating EFPIA companies. Crucially, their data on historical successes and failures in antibacterial research and development allows a more streamlined approach to antimicrobial drug development and will help to speed up the drug discovery process by making it more efficient. Additionally, the TRANSLOCATION project will help coordinate the dissemination of information and knowledge from this and all other topics initiated under IMI’s ND4BB programme.Discovery and efficiency will bring a boost to drug development for antibacterials
In this project a large number of small and previously separate research problems are combined allowing for synergy and understanding of how antibiotics move in and out of cells on a new and innovative level. This collaboration will bring together the antibacterial know-how of industry and leading academics with expertise in microbiology, biophysics and computational and structural biology to provide a holistic view of the problem and a novel approach to deliver advances in this challenging area. TRANSLOCATION will help close the gap between the burden of infections due to multidrug-resistant bacteria and the development of new antibiotics to tackle the problem. ","Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Basilea Pharmaceutica International AG, Basel, Switzerland:Glaxosmithkline Research And Development LTD., Brentford, Middlesex, United Kingdom:Janssen Pharmaceutica Nv, Beerse, Belgium:Sanofi-Aventis Recherche & Developpement, Chilly Mazarin, France","Assistance Publique - Hopitaux De Paris, Paris, France:Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs, Paris, France:Fraunhofer Gesellschaft Zur Foerderung Der Angewandten Forschung E.V., München, Germany:Fundacion Privada Instituto De Salud Global Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain:Jacobs University gGmbH, Bremen, Germany:Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universitatfrankfurt Am Main, Frankfurt am Main, Germany:Société civile SYNCHROTRON SOLEIL, GIF-sur-YVETTE CEDEX, France:The University Court of the University of St Andrews, St Andrews, Fife, United Kingdom:Universitaetsklinikum Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany:Universitat Basel, Basel, Switzerland:Universite D'Aix Marseille, Marseille, France:Universite De Geneve, Genève 4, Switzerland:University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland:University Of Newcastle Upon Tyne, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom:Università di Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy","GRITsystems A/S, Dragør, Denmark:Ionovation GmbH, Osnabrück, Germany:Nanion Technologies GmbH, München, Germany:The Hyve BV, Utrecht, Netherlands:Yelen, Ensues La Redonne, France","Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany",,Assistance Publique - Hopitaux De Paris:103 931:Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnrs:540 600:European ScreeningPort GmbH (left the project):232 618:Fraunhofer Gesellschaft Zur Foerderung Der Angewandten Forschung E.V.:672 679:Fundacion Privada Instituto De Salud Global Barcelona:203 639:GRITsystems A/S:349 875:Ionovation GmbH:450 400:Jacobs University gGmbH:4 178 960:Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universitatfrankfurt Am Main:499 000:Nanion Technologies GmbH:293 200:Nanospot GmbH (left the project):57 284:Société civile SYNCHROTRON SOLEIL:304 000:The Hyve BV:326 064:The University Court of the University of St Andrews:886 152:Universitaetsklinikum Freiburg:299 351:Universitat Basel:1 221 131:Universite D'Aix Marseille:1 653 621:Universite De Geneve:937 537:University College Dublin:90 313:University Of Newcastle Upon Tyne:894 625:Università di Cagliari:1 678 960:Yelen:110 263:Total Cost:15 984 203,http://www.nd4bb.eu,Yes,"IMI: Maria Teresa De Magistris

Thanks to U-BIOPRED, it will soon be easier to select the right patients for the right drug, bringing concrete socio-economic benefits.
The biggest project on severe asthma to dateAbout 300 million people worldwide suffer from asthma, with 250 000 annual deaths attributed to the disease and it is estimated that the number of people with asthma will grow by more than 100 million by 2025. Despite these statistics, not many new drugs have been developed to treat this disease since the invention of corticosteroids in mid 1940s. That’s partly because corticosteroids work well for 92-97% of asthma patients and there was no strong commercial incentive to look for new drugs. However, 3-8% of patients—those with severe asthma—do not respond to corticosteroids or other existing treatments. What’s more, those patients require frequent hospital admissions and account for half of all the asthma healthcare costs.The U-BIOPRED project was the biggest and most complex research project undertaken to understand severe asthma to date. It aimed to speed up the development of better treatments for patients with severe asthma by understanding the disease in more depth. More specifically, its main goal was to identify different subtypes or ‘handprints’ of severe asthma by adding complex biological markers to clinical characteristics, so that new treatments can better target the disease in different patients.Groundbreaking discovery of asthma subtypesThis was done in several stages: first the researchers recruited 1 025 patients with severe asthma – both adults and children. Secondly, researchers took blood, airway, breath and urine samples of those patients and analysed tens of thousands of proteins and molecules looking for common patterns. They wanted to know if patients could be divided into subtypes based on a combination of those biomolecules as well as a number of other clinical indicators.Analysing all this information in 1 025 patients and looking for patterns was no small feat but thanks to bioinformatics specialists in the project, it was a success. By the end of the project, the analysis revealed that there are four to five subtypes of severe asthma among adult patients (depending on the clinical and biological markers used), a discovery which is already paving the way for the development of more effective treatments. Initial results also show that there might be several, slightly different subtypes of asthma in children, but that analysis is still on-going.Unprecedented cooperation and other achievementsIn addition to discovering a number of subtypes of severe asthma in adult patients, the project recorded a number of other achievements, including:Reaching a consensus between industry and the academic partners on what constitutes severe asthma and how it differs from ‘difficult’ asthma. The consensus was published and is being taken up by others, such as the International Primary Care Respiratory Group. It will be updated in the near future to include final project results.Building a registry withdata from 1 025 patients belonging to eight different groups (so-called ‘cohorts’), some of which have never been studied before. For example, the project included four different groups of children, from preschool wheezers to asthmatic school-age children. This is significant because no study has ever studied children of various ages in combination with adults before – until now they were considered young adults. The registry will be an asset in future research.Establishing exemplary cooperation between all project partners, including 12 pharmaceutical companies, academia and patient groups. According to project participants, the results achieved in this project could not have been achieved by one company or academic institution alone. It was a truly collaborative effort.Building a biobank with more than 50 000 severe asthma patient samples (e.g. blood, sputum, lung tissue, urine), available for future research.Creating a certified rhinovirus challenge model which can mimic asthma attacks or exacerbations. Exacerbations are a key unresolved problem in severe asthma and it is difficult to recruit patients when they suffer from them. Therefore this virus could be an important asset in future research.Nourishing exemplary patient involvement. Patients played a big role in the project, including participation in the scientific and the ethics boards. They helped in many aspects of the project, including fine-tuning research protocols and providing encouragement during difficult times. A handbook on how to successfully ensure patient participation in research was also produced.Producing almost 70 scientific papers which are now in various stages of preparation.The data from U-BIOPRED to benefit companies, patients and academiaThe knowledge and data from U-BIOPRED is already being used extensively by the pharmaceutical companies to address a number of key bottlenecks in drug discovery which will bring immense benefits to patients:Identifying and validating drug targets. As U-BIOPRED has mapped the biological processes of severe asthma in patients, companies now have a clearer view on which biological processes should be targeted with future drugs.Decisions on which drugs to invest in. Thanks to the U-BIOPRED data, companies can now predict whether some of the drugs which they have in the pipeline will be effective for severe asthma patients.Getting the right drugs to the right patients. There are already some new drugs for asthma and severe asthma which work in some patients and not in others. By using the handprints as part of clinical trials, companies and caretakers can now start predicting whether or not a certain drug will be effective in individual patients. In the long run, this will be very beneficial for patients because they won’t be unnecessarily treated by drugs which don’t work for their asthma subtype.The project will also benefit the academic community as the knowledge, networks and experience gained will inform many future studies and collaborations.What happens next?Even though the official funding for the project ended, the analysis and validation of the data will continue through on-going contributions from various consortium members and other organisations such as the European Respiratory Society. In the long-term, the researchers will try to answer some of the following questions:How well do different subtypes of asthma identified in this project persist over time?Do individual patients move between different subtypes of severe asthma?Are the same subtypes of severe asthma present in other populations?What are the similarities and discrepancies of handprints between severe asthma and the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?Some of these research questions might be addressed in future H2020-funded studies and IMI projects.Read the interview with the project’s scientific coordinator, Peter Sterk","Amgen, Brussels, Belgium:Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Boehringer Ingelheim Internationalgmbh, Ingelheim, Germany:Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A, Parma, Italy:F.

ULTRA-DD,,Dorthy Reilly (Novartis),Novartis,completing before August 2020,01/03/2015,29/02/2020,IMI1,11,Group Cross,Unrestricted leveraging of targets for research advancement and drug discovery,Autoimmune diseases:Drug discovery,RIA (Research and Innovation Action),115766,21 200 000,21 664 981,,7 443 804,"The ULTRA-DD project’s goal is to deliver new tools and resources to speed up the development of truly innovative medicines, especially in the areas of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, where new treatments are urgently needed. Through the Structural Genomics Consortium, ULTRA-DD has strong ties with similar initiatives elsewhere in the world, and this, coupled with the project’s strong open access policy, will ensure that the tools, resources, and knowledge generated by the project will benefit the entire scientific community and hopefully result in new drug discovery programmes.
New medicines that work via novel, previously unexploited mechanisms are known as ‘first-in-class’ treatments and developing them is extremely challenging. Firstly, the early stages of drug development often involve tests using either simple cultures of human cells or animal models of diseases. However, these are often poor mimics of how diseases actually behave in humans, and positive results in these early studies do not always translate into safe, effective treatments for patients. Furthermore, even if reliable disease models are available, tools to study them in depth may be lacking. Finally, the expertise and resources required to develop these new tools is found in a range of different organisations; industry has experience of designing new tools, the clinical community has closer contact with patients and intimate knowledge of diseases, and the academic community typically has more expertise regarding the molecular biology of diseases.By bringing together representatives of these different communities to create an open, collaborative partnership, ULTRA-DD is well placed to deliver the tools, resources and knowledge that will advance research, speed up drug development, and benefit the wider research community.Focus on autoimmune and inflammatory diseasesA large part of the project is dedicated to developing research tools based on high-quality samples of cells and tissues from patients with specific diseases. These tools will allow researchers to study diseases in depth. ULTRA-DD will focus on two important areas where safe, effective treatments are currently lacking: autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Autoimmune diseases up for study in ULTRA-DD include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), idiopathic myositis, Sjögren’s syndrome, and systemic sclerosis. Collectively, these diseases are known as systemic inflammatory autoimmune diseases and they affect around 1% of the population in Western countries. Although their symptoms vary, they are all caused when the immune system attacks the body’s own tissues. There is currently no cure for these diseases and existing treatments are not effective in all patients and often come with unpleasant side effects.The second disease category studied in ULTRA-DD is immune diseases that trigger damage to the bones and cartilage, such as fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive (FOP) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). FOP is an extremely rare, currently-incurable condition in which bone forms in the muscles and soft tissues of the body. AS is a type of arthritis that mainly affects the spine is found in around 0.2% of the population. Again, more research is needed to find effective treatments for these devastating diseases.Another part of the project is developing a suite of probes, tests and methodologies to study these disease-specific research materials in depth.In addition. through project partner the Structural Genomics Consortium, ULTRA-DD will work closely with related initiatives carrying out similar work on neurological diseases and cancer.Wide-ranging impactsIn order to ensure the project results are taken up and used widely, ULTRA-DD operates an open access policy. The wider scientific community will therefore have ready access to much of the knowledge, data and tools generated by the project. Ultimately, the hope is that ULTRA-DD will dramatically increase our understanding of the underlying molecular causes of the diseases under investigation and so reinvigorate drug discovery pipelines.For patients, whose input is key to the success of this project, ULTRA-DD demonstrates that the entire health research and drug development community is pulling together to speed up the search for new, safer, more effective treatments.","Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, Leverkusen, Germany:Janssen Pharmaceutica Nv, Beerse, Belgium:Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland:Pfizer Limited, Sandwich, Kent , United Kingdom","Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich, Zurich, Switzerland:Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden:Structural Genomics Consortium, London, United Kingdom:University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom","DiscoveRx Corp Ltd, Birmingham, United Kingdom:The Governing Council of the University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada",,,Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich:1 440 970:Karolinska Institutet:4 902 660:Structural Genomics Consortium:1 353 696:University of Oxford:13 502 674:Total Cost:21 200 000,https://ultra-dd.org,missing from list,"IMI: Magda Gunn

The outbreak highlighted the urgent need for safe, effective vaccines against the highly infectious disease.One vaccine that is already at an advanced stage of development is called VSV-ZEBOV (vesicular stomatitis virus – Zaire Ebola vaccine). Clinical trials of the vaccine started in Guinea, one of the most affected countries, during the outbreak. Trials have also been carried out in Europe and the US. These revealed that the vaccine is safe, generates an immune response, and offers high levels of protection against Ebola. However, researchers still have many questions about VSV-ZEBOV: How exactly does it work? How long does it offer protection against Ebola, and what influences this? And, importantly, how well does the vaccine work in children?The VSV-EBOPLUS project aims to use systems biology approaches to decipher the molecular and immune signatures of responses to the vaccine in both adults and children in the short and long term. To do this, they will study blood samples taken from different groups, including adults and children who have just received the vaccine. They will also carry out yearly follow-up visits with two of the largest cohorts, in Gabon and Switzerland, for five years following vaccination.The project hopes that the results will deliver novel insights into the mechanisms of action of VSV-ZEBOV, and provide signatures that can be used to accurately assess both the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.",,,,,,,https://vsv-eboplus.eu/,#N/A,#N/A,"Donata MEDAGLINI,

This allows them to gather vital information on both the strength of the immune responses triggered by the vaccine and vaccine safety.A part of the Ebola+ ProgrammeThe IMI Ebola+ programme was launched in response to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak that started in western Africa in 2014. The comprehensive programme contributes to efforts to tackle a wide range of challenges in Ebola research, including vaccines development, clinical trials, and transport, as well as diagnostics. The programme complements work being carried out with the support of other funding bodies. In addition to Ebola, the programme will also address related diseases, such as Marburg.About Ebolaand related diseasesEbola virus disease (EVD), previously known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is a rare and deadly disease caused by infection with one of the Ebola virus strains. The virus spreads in the human population through direct human-to-human contact with the bodily fluids of infected patients who are showing symptoms. It has an incubation period of 2-21 days, and it usually begins with flu-like symptoms, but rapidly progresses to multiple organ failure and blood-clotting abnormalities which manifest as internal and external haemorrhages (bleeding). It is fatal in between 25% and 90% of cases. There is currently no licensed treatment against EVD, and the development of treatments and preventive measures such as vaccines is hampered by challenges including manufacturing-related hurdles, the stability of vaccines during transport and storage, vaccine deployment, and the time taken to diagnose cases of EVD.Ebola is a member of the filovirus family of viruses, which also includes Marburg virus. Like Ebola, Marburg causes cause severe, often fatal haemorrhagic fever in humans and other primates (monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees), and like Ebola, it is transmitted directly from one person to another. (In contrast, other viruses that cause haemorrhagic fevers are spread via intermediate hosts - for example, dengue fever is transmitted by mosquitoes.) There is no specific treatment or vaccine against Marburg haemorrhagic fever.The 2014-15 Ebola epidemic was unprecedented in its scale and geographical distribution. By the middle of 2015, World Health Organization (WHO) statistics recorded over 27 000 cases and 11 000 deaths from the disease, most of them in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The epidemic highlighted the need for research into better vaccines, diagnostics and treatments to stop future epidemics in their tracks.","Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden, Leiden, Netherlands:Centre de Recherches Medicales de Lambaréné, Lambaréné, Gabon:Department of Health, Leeds, United Kingdom:Eberhard Karls Universitaet Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany:Eidgenossisches Departement Fur Verteidigung, Bevolkerungsschutz Und Sport, Bern, Switzerland:Emory University Non Profit Corp, Atlanta, Georgia, United States :Goeteborgs Universitet, Gothenburg, Sweden:Sclavo Vaccines Association, Siena, Italy:Universita' Degli Studi Di Siena, Siena, Italy:Universite De Geneve, Genève 4, Switzerland:University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom","Bioprotection Systems Corporation, Ames, United States :Microbiotec SRL, Siena, Italy",,,,Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden:522 552:Bioprotection Systems Corporation:62 500:Centre de Recherches Medicales de Lambaréné:118 875:Department of Health:125 000:Eberhard Karls Universitaet Tuebingen:9 375:Emory University Non Profit Corp:600 888:Goeteborgs Universitet:700 000:Microbiotec SRL:212 500:Sclavo Vaccines Association:841 250:Universita' Degli Studi Di Siena:562 500:University of Oxford:131 820:Total Cost:3 887 260,http://www.vsv-ebovac.eu/en/home.html,Yes,"IMI: Angela Wittelsberger

WEB-RADR,,,Novartis,Closed,01/09/2014,31/12/2017,IMI1,9,Group Cross,Recognising Adverse Drug Reactions,Tools for predicting/monitoring efficacy:Digital health,RIA (Research and Innovation Action),115632,2 270 000,2 754 044,,916 352,"Detecting the adverse effects of medicines – as well as their misuse – poses a big challenge for health authorities. Under-reporting is an issue, with individuals sometimes more likely to express their frustration via social media channels than consult their doctor. By bringing together industry and academic experts, regulators, patients and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), IMI’s WEB-RADR project developed a mobile application which allows patients to directly report potential medicine side effects and also receive reliable information on their drugs. The work done in this project is already helping medicine manufacturers and regulators to detect new safety signals and intervene earlier in case of adverse drug reactions, thus improving medicine monitoring and patient safety.Pharmacovigilance is the monitoring of the safety of medicines to identify new or changing risks to support the safe and effective use of medicines. This includes the monitoring and reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), i.e. side effects that can be experienced during treatment. Patients experiencing ADRs and their healthcare professionals are requested to report these side effects to their national pharmacovigilance centre. However, paper-based report forms are not always available and are often perceived as inconvenient and complex. If more reports were submitted, this could facilitate the faster identification of risks.To address this, IMI’s WEB-RADR project has developed a mobile app that allows users of pharmaceutical products to directly report ADRs to relevant health authorities, find out about reported side effects and opt to receive alerts on specific medicines. During the project, the app was rolled out across three EU countries – Croatia, the Netherlands, and the UK – and had about 10 000 downloads in those countries alone.Thanks to collaboration with the World Health Organization, the app was also rolled out to support malaria programmes in two African countries: Burkina Faso and Zambia. The implementation of the app in those countries had a substantial impact, with Burkina Faso receiving more ADR reports in the first six months after the roll out than they had in all the time previously.A dozen additional countries around the world have also expressed interest in the app and some have already adopted it. For example, in early 2018 the United Arab Emirates also launched the app.The reports received via the app have already contributed to the identification of new safety issues with various medicines, enabling regulatory authorities in relevant countries to take appropriate action.Social media data miningThe WEB-RADR project team also explored the value of social media data for pharmacovigilance. They found that in certain circumstances it could be hugely valuable and that people are far more likely to discuss issues like medicine misuse on social media than with their doctor. To mine this wealth of data, the team developed methods to detect, extract, standardise and analyse medicine-related information reported in unstructured free text by social media users.This has already led to concrete insights. For example, thanks to social media mining, the team uncovered patterns of misuse of a particular medicine by communities of students who want to improve their performance around examination time. This has provided additional information to the traditional sources, because students would normally not share this information with their doctors and pharmacists.WEB-RADR policy recommendations on the collection and use of data – both through the app and social media mining – have been passed on to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for implementation in future guidance on how the pharmacovigilance legislation in the EU should be operated.Ethical and data protection issuesA consistent area of concern for the project was potential conflicts over data gathering and privacy regulations, as well as ethical considerations about harvesting social media data. To address this, the researchers engaged leading medical ethicists and data protection experts to assist them. That set a sound and robust framework for the analysis that they were doing, ensuring that they were both operating within the law and conducting the work in accordance with the highest ethical standards.Benefits for industry, academia and SMEsThe industry is already benefitting from the tools and resources developed within this project, especially from the guidelines on how they can use social media to monitor drug safety issues and improve their interaction with patients and carers.The academic community has benefitted from the exchange of ideas and viewpoints with different stakeholders in the project, as well as from innovative research ideas and identification of new research areas. SMEs have also benefitted from the network formed within the project, and have expanded their businesses.Finally, patients and healthcare providers benefitted from gaining a new, user-friendly way to report adverse drug reactions and receive official, reliable and regulator-approved information on their treatments via the mobile app.What’s next?In order to enable other countries in the EU and beyond to benefit from the tools developed in the project, the project partners have put in place a sustainability plan. Among other things, the project set up a management board that will support the growth of the mobile app as well as its continued development and enhancements beyond the lifetime of the project.In line with IMI’s open innovation approach, the data and reference standards obtained during the course of the project will soon be published so that other researchers could build on the WEB-RADR work. Furthermore, the project’s scientific deliverables have been described in two scientific papers – as of August 2018, their publication is still pending.Read the interview with project coordinators.","Amgen, Brussels, Belgium:Astrazeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden:Bayer Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany:Glaxosmithkline Research And Development LTD., Brentford, Middlesex, United Kingdom:Janssen Pharmaceutica Nv, Beerse, Belgium:Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland:Sanofi-Aventis Recherche & Developpement, Chilly Mazarin, France:UCB Biopharma SPRL, Brussels, Belgium","Academisch Ziekenhuis Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands:Croatian Agency for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices, Zagreb, Croatia:Department of Health, Leeds, United Kingdom:Stichting Lareb, 's Hertogenbosch, Netherlands:Stiftelsen WHO Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring, Uppsala, Sweden:The European Medicines Agency, Canary Wharf, London, United Kingdom:The University Of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom:University College London, London, United Kingdom","Epidemico Limited, Irishtown, Ireland:SRDC  Yazilim  Arastirma  ve  Gelistirme ve Danismanlik Tic.

Known as zoonoses, these diseases represent a serious threat to both human and animal health. ZAPI brings together experts in human and animal health to create new platforms and technologies that will facilitate a fast, coordinated, and practical response to new infectious diseases as soon as they emerge.
25 outbreaks in 20 years New infectious diseases are emerging at an increasing frequency in the EU and other regions of the world, with the potential to profoundly impact public and animal health, and strongly disrupt local and international economies. The majority of these diseases are zoonoses, meaning they originate in or are transmitted by animals. In the last 20 years, there have been 25 documented emerging diseases that moved from wild or domestic animals to human populations. It is highly probable that zoonoses that spread rapidly (many of them are insect-borne diseases) in one or several EU countries will continue or increase due to environmental and demographic changes. The EU has already been affected by many zoonoses over the past 20 years, for example, West Nile virus, chikungunya and influenza H5N1.Too many delays in vaccine deliveryDue to the unpredictable nature of the zoonotic outbreaks, the rapid development of containment and control programmes is critical to the well-being of both human and animal populations. Current vaccine development platforms, however, may not be appropriate to come up with effective products that can trigger a protective response. Additionally, in most cases these platforms rely on cell lines from mammals, which may not be readily available and may not yield enough material to address outbreaks. Furthermore, long regulatory processes for product approval may delay their applications. All of this results in unacceptable delays in vaccine delivery to the populations in needs. Collaborative approach needed Zoonoses clearly demonstrate that the health of the people is closely interlinked with the health of the animals and the environment – these types of diseases require a ‘One Health’ approach to research, which includes measures in the human and veterinary field. Today, no individual organisation has either the expertise or the resources available to ensure full readiness for delivering efficient control tools against future outbreaks. Therefore, close collaboration among governmental regulatory agencies, academic groups and industrial partners is a must for achieving such an ambitious objective.What does ZAPI bring to the table?By bringing together more than 20 partners, including leading human and veterinary research institutions, non-governmental organisations, regulatory agencies, academic groups and manufacturers, ZAPI aims to shorten the time to respond to emerging infectious diseases by using a multidisciplinary, One Health approach. The project aims to produce both platforms for the rapid production of veterinary vaccines and antibodies to protect the human population. The project also aims to ensure fast-track registration and implementation of the control tools after the emergence of the disease. 
More specifically, the project is working towards:creating platforms that allow rapid identification and production of antibodies capable of neutralising emerging viruses; creating platforms suitable for rapid increases in the production of vaccines;enabling the development of quality control assays that do not make use of animals;establishing protocols for fast track registration of developed products.Focusing on three key virusesIt is less expensive to control new infectious diseases in animals compared to the high costs triggered when the disease spreads to people. Therefore, the focus of the project is on three pathogens which occur first in animals before moving to people. Rift Valley fever virus causes recurrent outbreaks among ruminants (e.g. cattle, sheep and goats) and humans across the African continent, several islands of the Western Indian Ocean, and the Arabian peninsula. It is transmitted by mosquitoes. Infection can cause severe illness and/or death in animals and humans, as well as economic losses due to death and abortion among infected livestock.Schmallenberg virus is associated with abortions, stillbirths and malformations in ruminants in Asia, Africa and Oceania. It emerged in Europe for the first time in 2011 and is transmitted by mosquitoes. No evidence of human infection has been reported but related viruses have zoonotic potential.Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus first emerged in the Arabian peninsula in 2012, causing severe lower respiratory tract disease in humans. Approximately 36% of the reported patients have died. Camels are likely to be a major animal source of infection in humans.Significant impact while reducing animal testingZAPI’s innovative approaches aim to result in significant scientific and technological impact, leading to a faster response to newly emerging viruses. Furthermore, the ZAPI platform will reduce the number of animal experiments necessary for the development of vaccines, and will minimize the need for control tests in animals for the regulatory release of commercial vaccine batches.Achievements so farA year after the launch, the project is already yielding its first results. The results generated so far confirm the initial hypothesis that it should be possible to generate viral vaccines based on small subunits expressed in systems other than the classical mammalian or avian cells. Additionally, some of the project milestones have already been achieved ahead of schedule including the generation of key neutralizing antibodies against all 3 target viruses. In addition,  a consensus on industrial and regulatory processes needed to deliver key vaccines and/or antibodies in quantities needed to address outbreaks was obtained; methodology to determine constraints and criteria for the selection of systems for industrial scale-up; as well as innovative advances for the design in vitro QC assays, and innovative advances in the design of vaccine candidates were developed. ",,,,,,,http://www.zapi-imi.eu,missing from list,"IMI: Magda Gunn
